"Shoreline Master Program Update (Kitsap County)","In 1971, the people of the State of Washington voted for the Shoreline Management Act (SMA). This ultimately created three primary purposes: 1) To protect ecological functions; 2) To accommodate appropriate uses; and 3) To maintain public access. The Shoreline Master Program (SMP) implements the policies of the SMA at the local level by regulating use and development along shorelines. The Department of Ecology is responsible for ensuring that the local SMP is consistent with the intent of the SMA, and has final approval authority.  As part of a comprehensive update to the SMP of Kitsap County, a task-force of citizens with shoreline-related interests were to be selected to work with County staff to develop goals, policies, and to assist in recommending regulations on SMP issues that need to be updated.  The Kitsap County Board of Commissioners authorized the development of an SMP task-force and was funded to assist until June 30, 2011 or longer should sufficient resources be available. On March 8, 2010, the task-force plan was adopted and 20 volunteer citizens were selected by the Kitsap County Board of Commissioners, signed by then Chairperson Josh Brown and Commissioner Steve Bauer.  The members of the task-force were then charged with the responsibility to recommend new policy, regulations, and environmental designations, as deemed necessary by the SMP update. To do so, they were instructed to utilize all existing information including the shoreline inventory and characterization, become familiar with the established work plan and focus on specific topics from that work plan, work cooperatively with Kitsap County staff, and review draft shoreline regulations that were to be guided by the Shoreline Management Act major policy goals. The final task-force meeting took place on January 24, 2012, whereby the most current SMP recommendation was voted upon and submitted to the Department of Ecology for further approval.","Mission and PurposeShoreline Master Programs are local land use policies and regulations designed to manage shoreline use. These local programs protect natural resources for future generations, provide public access to public waters and shores, and plan...","","United States","","","","20"

The plan also requires the Progress Board to issue reviews and recommendations for any addition, alteration, or deletion of current goals or benchmarks in order to ensure the plan is operating at maximum potential and securing a prosperous future for the Tasmanian community.","MissonTasmania Together is a community action plan that was developed by a broad group of citizens in conjunction with the Tasmanian government in order to promote long-term social, economic, and environmental goals of the Australian state.

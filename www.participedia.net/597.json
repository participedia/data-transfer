A <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-initiative-review\">Citizen's Initiative Review</a> is a <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury\">Citizens\u2019 Jury</a> that deliberates about a ballot <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/initiative-process\">initiative</a>. The Citizens' Initiative Review that has been incorporated into the Oregon statewide ballot initiative process is called the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir\">Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review</a> (Oregon CIR).</p><p>[Photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.healthydemocracyfund.org/\">Healthy Democracy</a>]</p><h3>History</h3><p>According to Tyrone Reitman, Ned Crosby -- founder of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/jefferson-center\">the Jefferson Center</a>, which developed the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury\">Citizens\u2019 Jury</a> -- and his wife Patricia Benn advocated for the use of the CIR in Oregon in 2003.</p><p>In 2006 Tyrone Reitman and Elliot Shuford, colleagues from the University of Oregon, organized a project to introduce the CIR in Oregon. Crosby and Benn agreed to fund the project. \u00a0In early 2007 Reitman and Shuford founded <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/healthy-democracy-oregon\">Healthy Democracy Oregon</a> (HDO), an organization that would carry out the project, which was called the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir\">Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review</a> (Oregon CIR). After a successful trial in 2008 the Oregon Legislature authorized the Oregon CIR for the 2010 election. In 2010 HDO organized two Oregon CIRs, of which Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review 2010 Measure 74, held \u00a0August 16-20, \u00a0was the second.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review 2010 Measure 74 (Oregon CIR 2010 M74) was organized by Healthy Democracy (HDO). HDO's funding for Oregon CIR 2010 M74 came from grants from foundations and nonprofit organizations, contributions from HDO board members, and private donations from Oregon citizens. \u00a0Some funding for Oregon CIR 2010 M74 came from the organization <a href=\"http://promotinghealthydemocracy.org/\">Promoting Healthy Democracy</a>, of which Crosby was a co-founder. \u00a0HDO did not receive funding from the state of Oregon for Oregon CIR 2010 M74.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3>The Oregon CIR involves four categories of participants: panelists, the citizens who deliberate about a ballot initiative; advocates, individuals who are knowledgeable about the ballot initiative and who argue in support of or in opposition to the ballot initiative; stakeholders, individuals who will be affected by the ballot initiative, who also argue in support of or in opposition to the ballot initiative; and background witnesses, individuals who are knowledgeable about issues related to the initiative, and who present neutral background information about those issues to the panelists. \u00a0<p>To select the panelists for Oregon CIR 2010 M74, HDO used a selection process designed in cooperation with the Portland, Oregon survey research firm of <a href=\"http://www.dhmresearch.com/\">Davis, Hibbitts, and Midghall, Inc</a>. <a href=\"http://www.lwvor.org/\">The League of Women \u00a0Voters of Oregon</a> monitored the selection process. The selection process was as follows: HDO took a probability sample of 10,000 Oregon voters. All voters in this sample were sent an invitation to participate in the 2010 Oregon CIR and a demographic survey. Three hundred fifty members of the sample responded, for a response rate of 3.5%. From those who responded, HDO, using the demographic data from the sample survey, anonymously chose 24 panelists and 5 alternate panelists for each 2010 Oregon CIR. The panelists and alternates for each CIR were chosen using stratification so that each panel closely matched the Oregon population in terms of place of residence, political partisanship, education, ethnicity/race, gender, and age. Nonetheless, because some originally selected panelists could not attend, the Oregon CIR 2010 M74 panel differed slightly from the Oregon population in that the panel included one more college-educated member, one fewer member having a high-school education or less, one more member from each of Oregon's second and fifth congressional districts, one fewer member from Oregon\u2019s first congressional district, one more member of the Republican Party, and one fewer politically Independent member than the selection plan provided. HDO paid panelists' travel, accommodation, and child care costs, and a stipend of $150 per day.</p><p>For Oregon CIR 2010 M74 the advocates included the proponents of the ballot initiative, Measure 74, and a sheriff and a district attorney, both of whom opposed Measure 74. Stakeholders were selected by the advocates, and included, for the proponents of Measure 74, four medical marijuana activists, three medical marijuana patients, an advocate for medical marijuana patients, a physician who conducted research on medical marijuana, and a leader of the committee that advises the Oregon Department of Human Services on the state\u2019s medical marijuana program. The opponents of Measure 74 chose no stakeholders.</p><p>To select background witnesses HDO identified individuals recognized as experts on issues related to Measure 74 and obtained names of additional potential witnesses from the advocates. This yielded a list of seventy potential background witnesses whom HDO interviewed to learn more about the individuals\u2019 expertise, availability to present to the panel, and support for or opposition to Measure 74. With the goal of creating a list of background witnesses having diversity of expertise and experiences and being roughly balanced in terms of support for or opposition to Measure 74 HDO then chose the final list of background witnesses. The panel then chose to hear from seven of these background witnesses, among whom were the former deputy drug czar for the U.S. federal government, two active-duty police officers, a retired police officer, a medical marijuana patient advocate, the official who ran the rulemaking process within the Oregon Department of Public Health, and a health law researcher.\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>On Day 1 of the Oregon CIR 2010 M74 the CIR organizers explained the charge to the panelists. The panel\u2019s charge was to write a Citizens\u2019 Statement explaining key factual findings about Measure 74 that at least 14 of the 24 panelists agreed about, stating how many panelists supported or opposed Measure 74, and setting out the panelists\u2019 arguments for supporting or opposing the measure. Each of the three parts of the Citizens\u2019 Statement\u2014the key findings, arguments supporting the measure, and arguments opposing the measure\u2014was to be limited to 130 words. Next, the CIR organizers and moderators explained to the panel the CIR procedures and briefly explained Measure 74. Much of Day 1 consisted of a practice deliberation in which the panelists gained experience in using the CIR procedures by applying those procedures to a hypothetical ballot initiative concerning a bond issue to fund the preservation of a historic courthouse in a fictional Oregon town.<p>The next three days were dedicated to hearings at which advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses presented arguments and information to the panel. During the hearings panelists were given the opportunity to ask question of the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses. On each day after the hearings panelists deliberated in small groups, and then engaged in a discussion among all the panelists during which panelists shared results of their small-group discussions. Each day each panelist was assigned to a different small group and to a different seat during the full-panel discussion, in order to expose each panelist to a diversity of views and to prevent contiguity between panelists from influencing panelists\u2019 decisions. (The daily seating assignments were made manually and were not randomized.) Trained moderators led the questioning and deliberations to ensure that all advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses were treated fairly and that all panelists had the opportunity to be heard.</p><p>At the end of each day panelists completed surveys about the substance and quality of their deliberations. The surveys were designed and distributed by John Gastil and Katherine Knobloch, researchers who conducted a formal study of the Oregon 2010 CIRs.</p><p>Deliberations during Days 2, 3, 4, and the morning of Day 5, which were held in public and were videorecorded, focused on information gathering. During deliberations on the afternoon of Day 5 panelists made final judgments about whether to support or oppose Measure 74 and then, during discussions that were held in private and not recorded, formulated arguments to justify those judgments.\u00a0</p><p>On Day 2 in the morning panelists heard arguments from advocates and stakeholders supporting or opposing Measure 74. In the afternoon as part of the full-panel discussion panelists chose background witnesses whom they wished to hear from, advocates and stakeholders whom they wished to hear from a second time, and questions they wished to ask the witnesses, advocates, and stakeholders.</p><p>On Day 3 the background witnesses, advocates, and stakeholders chosen the day before made presentations to the panelists. Panelists\u2019 deliberations concerned identifying key factual findings concerning Measure 74 and stating what panelists considered to be the most persuasive reasons for supporting or opposing Measure 74.</p><p>On Day 4 advocates made closing arguments in the morning. In the afternoon of Day 4 and the morning of Day 5 panelists finalized the phrasing of key factual findings concerning Measure 74 and voted to identify the most important of those findings. Some panelists also met in groups on the evening of Day 4 to revise the wording of some key factual findings. A vote of 14 out of 24 panelists was needed for a key finding to be included in the Citizens\u2019 Statement. In addition panelists discussed whether they supported or opposed Measure 74 in light of the key findings they had selected and all other information and arguments they had heard.</p><p>In the afternoon of Day 5 panelists divided into two groups: those supporting Measure 74 and those opposing the measure. During those group discussions, which were held in private and not recorded, panelists selected what they believed to be the strongest arguments justifying their positions on Measure 74 and finalized the wording of those arguments. Panelists and HDO personnel also read, fact-checked, and commented on opposing panelists' arguments, in a discussion that led to additional revisions to both sides' arguments. Those arguments were then included in the Citizens\u2019 Statement. \u00a0In the final Citizens\u2019 Statement 13 panelists supported Measure 74 and 11 panelists opposed the measure.\u00a0</p><p>After finishing their deliberations on Day 5 panelists completed an evaluation of the Oregon CIR process and of the Oregon CIR organizers and moderators. In their evaluations panelists were required to apply several criteria, including the quality of the deliberations and any bias in the process or exhibited by Oregon CIR personnel. In addition each panelist had the opportunity in the evaluation to write a personal statement expressing views that were not included in the Citizens\u2019 Statement.\u00a0</p><p>At 4:00 p.m. on Day 5 HDO held a press conference at which the panelists of Oregon CIR 2010 M74 presented their Citizens\u2019 Statement to the public and the media.</p><p>The Citizens\u2019 Statement was included in <a href=\"http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/pamphlet/november-general-2010.aspx\">the official 2010 Oregon voters\u2019 pamphlet.</a></p><p>Some time after Oregon CIR 2010 M74 had concluded HDO published<a href=\"http://cirarchive.org/media/attachments/documents/M74_Final_Report.pdf\"> </a>a final report that included the Measure 74\u00a0Citizens\u2019 Statement, the panelists\u2019 evaluations of Oregon CIR 2010 M74, and descriptions of the Oregon CIR process.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>John Gastil, Katherine Knobloch, and colleagues conducted a study of the 2010 Oregon CIRs. Data for the study were obtained from the researchers\u2019 surveys completed daily by the panelists, the panelists\u2019 final evaluations of the Oregon CIR 2010 M74, and telephone and online surveys of Oregon citizens respecting their attitudes towards and knowledge of Measures 73 and 74 and their use of the official 2010 Oregon voters\u2019 guide and the Citizens\u2019 Statements for Measures 73 and 74. The online survey, of a panel of Oregon voters questioned first in August 2010 and then again in the two weeks before the November 2010 election, included an experiment to test the influence of the Citizens\u2019 Statements on voters\u2019 knowledge of and attitudes towards Measures 73 and 74.</p><p>The key results of Gastil and Knobloch's study, in terms of the Oregon CIR 2010 M74 panelists and the Measure 74 Citizens\u2019 Statement, were:</p><ul><li>The deliberations yielded sufficient information and featured a sufficiently rigorous analysis of Measure 74 to enable the panelists to make an informed decision about the measure.</li><li>The CIR process was fair. Twenty of 24 panelists were \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the neutrality of the CIR organizers and moderators.</li><li>The democratic quality of the deliberations was high. Panelists had equal opportunities to participate, treated each other respectfully, and maintained open minds towards others\u2019 views.</li><li>Panelists experienced a large change in attitude toward Measure 74 during the deliberations. At the beginning of the CIR 15 panelists (63%) were undecided about Measure 74, 3 supported it (13%) and 5 opposed it (21%) (one panelist did not answer the initial survey). At the end of the CIR no panelists remained undecided, 13 (54%) supported the measure, and 11 panelists (46%) opposed it.</li><li>The quality of the Citizens\u2019 Statement on Measure 74 was high. The statement contained no substantial factual or logical errors and the statement generally accurately reflected the panelists\u2019 deliberations and provided new and useful information for voters.</li></ul>In terms of the influence of the Measure 74 Citizens\u2019 Statement the key results of the study were:<ul><li>Most Oregon voters (58%) were unaware of the 2010 Oregon CIR and most (65%) did not read the Citizens\u2019 Statement concerning Measure 74.</li><li>31% of Oregon voters who read the Measure 74 Citizens\u2019 Statement learned new arguments or information from it.</li><li>Voters who read the Citizens\u2019 Statement spent much more time (an average of 11 minutes) reading the Citizens\u2019 Statement than reading other sections of the official voters\u2019 guide (average durations of 3 to 6 minutes per section).</li><li>Reading the Citizens' Statement\u00a0significantly increased voters' knowledge of and reduced voters' support for Measure 74. Only 39% of those who read the Citizens\u2019 Statement supported Measure 74, compared to 47% of those who did not read the Citizens\u2019 Statement.\u00a0</li><li>The effect of reading the Citizens' Statements on voters' opposition to Measure 74 was too small to have influenced the outcome of the 2010 Oregon statewide election, but was large enough to indicate that in a future close ballot initiative election a Citizens' Statement could\u00a0influence the outcome. On November 2, 2010, Oregon voters rejected Measure 74, with 56% of voters casting ballots against \u00a0the measure.</li></ul>In 2010 Gastil and Knobloch submitted the results of their study to the Oregon Legislature. In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a statute making the Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon\u2019s statewide initiative process. The preamble to the statute alludes to the results of Gastil and Knobloch\u2019s study.<h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3>Gastil and Knobloch in their 2010 report concluded that the CIR design used during the 2010 Oregon CIRs had been generally \"appropriate and effective.\" In their 2010 report and in subsequent papers they also recommended several modifications to the CIR process, which included the following:<p>The researchers observed that the Measure 74 Citizens\u2019 Statement failed expressly to identify the policy problem that the measure was intended to remedy. The researchers suggested that this may have contributed to the Citizens' Statement's unexpected effect of reducing readers\u2019 support for the measure even though a majority of panelists voted to support the measure.\u00a0</p><p>The researchers also found that the Measure 74 panelists left out of their Citizens\u2019 Statement some important types of information. \u00a0These included complex factual findings, such as that the evidence showed that only certain groups of patients had experienced difficulties obtaining medical marijuana, and expressions of the tradeoffs involved in opposing or adopting the measure, such as that enacting Measure 74 might well improve patients\u2019 access to medical marijuana but was also likely to increase drug-related crime enough to outweigh the benefits of the measure. The researchers observed that the panelists\u2019 reluctance to include such information may have been due to difficulties of phrasing the information in a way that voters could understand, or to the absence in the Citizens\u2019 Statement of categories of material appropriate to such information.</p><p>The researchers observed that the Day 5 deliberation in which panelists commented on arguments opposed to their own led to revisions that generally strengthened both sides\u2019 arguments. The researchers therefore concluded that CIR organizers should give panelists sufficient time to deliberate about their reasons for approving and opposing the initiative especially when one side has relatively little support because such deliberation improves the quality of those reasons.\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Binder, M., Boudreau, C., &amp; Kousser, T.

Lets take it one step at a time eh?\nIf you have already signed the petition, thanks! I\u2019d be most grateful if you could share this site with your friends.\nRoss O\u2019Mullane,\nFounder of United Minds,\nApril 2010.\n\n<a href=\"/methods/direct-democracy\" title=\"Direct Democracy\">Direct_Democracy</a> organisations present on Participedia", "title": "United Minds"}

It is very similar to many other state ran orginazation that tries to help promote the idea of Deliberative Democracy and helping the people in our country to learn to speak up and be informed about Political and Social issues. \n</p><p>The one set back of this organization is that it is very localized, and mainly focuses on the state of Kansas. However it is a very good model organization that could help motivate other states that don't currently have organizations like the ICDD to use them as an example to model after. Therefore if every state has their own ICDD than it can all work together to form one National ICDD.\n</p>\n<a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a><h2>References</h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/about\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/about</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/what-we-do</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://icdd.k-state.edu/\">http://icdd.k-state.edu/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.ruralgrocery.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.ruralgrocery.org/\">http://www.ruralgrocery.org/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://services.bepress.com/jpd/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://services.bepress.com/jpd/\">http://services.bepress.com/jpd/</a>\n</li></ul><a id=\"Secondary_Literature\" name=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h2>Secondary Literature</h2>\n<ul><li>David Procter Moderated a Lecture on Judicial Diversity (David Procter 2009)\n</li></ul><ul><li>The Deliberative Democracy Handbook\u2014Strategies for Effective Civic Engagement in the Twenty First Century (John Gastil, 2005)\n</li></ul><ul><li>Midterm Mud: Making a Mess of Elections (Jeffery Weiss 2010)\n</li></ul><a id=\"Links\" name=\"Links\"></a><h2>Links</h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html\">http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/\">http://www.heartlandfoundation.org/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/\">http://www.interactivityfoundation.org/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/\">http://www.kansasarmynationalguard.com/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.kettering.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.kettering.org/\">http://www.kettering.org/</a>\n</li><li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.deliberative-democracy.net\">http://www.deliberative-democracy.net</a>\n</li></ul>", "title": "The Institute for Civic Discourse & Democracy"}

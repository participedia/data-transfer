{"htmlbody": "The Freechild Project is a consulting program focused on creating meaningful connections between adults and young people through programs, technical assistance, publications, training, and curriculum. With offices in Olympia, Washington, Freechild works across the United States and Canada. The School Library Journal has said Freechild's website is, \"By far the largest repository of projects, ideas, and organizational links, this resource provides more than adequate information to help students brainstorm ideas in order to start their own initiatives.\"\n\n\n<a id=\"Mission\" name=\"Mission\"></a><h2> Mission </h2>\nThe mission of Freechild is \"to advocate, inform, and celebrate social change led by and with young people around the world, particularly those who have been historically denied the right to participate. The Freechild Project provides examples and resources to youth and their adult allies.\"&lt; The group advocates \"radical democracy.\"\n\n<a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a><h2> Activities </h2>\nThe Freechild Project believes it is completely unethical to exclude young people from meaningful involvement in the communities they occupy. Freechild's activities focus on service-learning, topic-specific workshops and activism incubation. Comprised of youth and adult consultants, Freechild consults with local and national nonprofit, government agencies, and K-12 schools in strategic planning, capacity building and product development focused on youth empowerment. They also facilitate networking activities through conferences and online communications.\nThe organization is coordinated by one full-time staff member, offers activities through a network of trainers, and is advised by youth and adult experts from across North America. \n\n<a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a><h2> Publications </h2>\n<ul><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/YouthVoice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/YouthVoice/\">Youth Voice Toolbox</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/FPYEWG.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/FPYEWG.htm\">Freechild Project Youth Engagement Workshop Guide</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/WYVH.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/WYVH.htm\">Washington Youth Voice Handbook</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/socialchangeguide.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/socialchangeguide.htm\">Guide to Social Change Led By and With Young People</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/gamesguide.htm\">Guide to Cooperative Games for Social Change</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/\">Firestarter Program Participant Guidebook</a>\n</li><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/Firestarter/\">Firestarter Facilitator's Guide</a>\n</li></ul><a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a><h2> External Links </h2>\n<ul><li> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.freechild.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.freechild.org/\">Official website</a>\n</li></ul>", "title": "The Freechild Project"}

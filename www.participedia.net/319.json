In addition, it fosters the participation of people around the continent in order to support and benefit the citizens of the African Union, promote incorporation of key African Union policy standards into national law by state and non-state figures, and lastly to encourage policies and programs that entail good social, political, economic, and cultural practices. The process of the CCP-AU encourages joint collaboration, research, discussion, and deliberation among participants and others in the African Union, therefore contributing to all the above key purposes. The CCP-AU believes in the inclusion of all African voices, and a citizenship that is underpinned with transparency and accountability. The CCP-AU believes that a successful country is one strengthened by the participation of its citizens, ultimately achieving collaborative development of the country. \n</p><p>The following is a list of the key objectives for the CCP-AU:\n</p><p>1.       To enhance African Civil Society Organizations\u2019 (CSOs) awareness and knowledge of the African Union\u2019s objectives and working procedures and provide up-to-date information of its activities\n2.       To serve as a link between African CSOs and the AU in enabling CSOs to access the Citizens and Diaspora Directorate (CIDO) and the Economic Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), the official organ for CSO participation in the African Union;\n3.       To organize, conduct and coordinate Continental CSO Conferences in the lead up to the AU\u2019s bi-annual summits with the view to enhance meaningful participation of African CSOs and generate a communiqu\u00e9 to enable CSOs to lobby Heads of States on AU Summit agenda issues;\n4.       To lobby and advocate the African Union member states to adopt agreements, protocols and other similar legal instruments that promote political, economical, social and cultural progress of African countries;\n5.       To advocate for the domestication of such adopted instruments into State parties\u2019 legal system and policy framework according to local legislations;\n6.       To raise, mobilize and disburse funds and other resources to enable African CSOs to participate in Continental CSO Conferences organized by the Centre.\n</p><p>The CCP-AU achieves it\u2019s key objectives through a number of strategies, including training workshops on the structures and functions of the African Union, collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs) to brainstorm new policies, supplying CSOs and other stakeholders with detailed and timely updates on the activities of the African Union through its website and listserv, as well as holding biannual Citizens\u2019 Continental Conferences. The latter allows delegates from all around the continent the ability to deliberate on issues of common concern, and subsequently relay concrete recommendations to the Heads of State and Government meetings.\n</p>\n<a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a><h1>History</h1>\n<p>\tThe CCP-AU began in 2007, originally with the intention of facilitating and creating the participation of CSOs and encouraging a clear understanding amongst citizens of the African Union, including its key functions and decision making processes. The CCP-AU has two office locations, one in Nairobi and another in Addis, however they are aspiring to have four locations very soon. The two current offices work with the African Union Commission, the AU Judicial Organs, and the NEPAD/APRM; its three main focal organizations. The CCP-AU began in order to allow discussion and deliberation amongst citizens and CSOs about five main themes prevalent to current concerns within the continent. The five themes are listed below:\n</p><p>\u2022\tAfrican Union Government and Regional Integration\n\u2022\tDemocracy, Governance, Human Rights and Leadership\n\u2022\tEconomic Justice\n\u2022\tGender Equality and Women\u2019s Rights\n\u2022\tPeace and Security\n</p><p>Membership and participation in the CCP-AU is open to any organization or interested citizen. Members are encouraged to partake in the CCP-AU in accordance with \u201cthe spirit and letter of the Constitutive Act of the African Union and African Court of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\u201d All organizations seeking to participate should be prepared to enhance and complement the values of the main themes listed previously. In addition, the CCP-AU website (<a href=\"http://www.ccpau.org\">www.ccpau.org</a>) is open to the public for registration. Being a registered member of the website keeps participants and interested citizens updated with news, progress, and developments occurring within the CCP-AU. Furthermore, there is a discussion forum on the website that allows everyone to participate and converse about current affairs, CCP-AU activities/projects, CCP-AU improvements, suggestions, and questions, as well as other general information regarding CSOs in Africa. \n</p>\n<a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a><h1>Activities</h1>\n<p>The CCP-AU\u2019s time and energy is committed to increasing civic participation and transparency within the AU. CCP-AU members attend and participate in annual or bi-annual nongovernmental and governmental meetings concerning policy to help improve the overall enhancement of democracy. In the major projects section below, it is evident that the CCP-AU contributes to the discussion and implementation of advocacy programs. Also, as discussed earlier, the CCP-AU is committed to promoting knowledge among the social, cultural, political and economic concerns in the AU and possible policy solutions. In doing so, the CCP-AU motivates its current and incoming members to attend state or regional events. The CCP-AU in turn provides logistical support to keep its members interested and continuously active in civic engagement. \n</p><p>Since 2007 the CCP-AU has held training workshops for more than 100 representatives of African Citizens and CSO\u2019s to focus on and study the structures of the AU and how to become engaged with it. In addition, the CCP-AU has organized five continental conferences, bringing together over 350 CSO representatives. These continental conferences resulted in the bi-annual summit results, which provided recommendations that were distributed to governmental delegates attending the conferences as well as the media. \n</p>\n<a id=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\" name=\"Major_Projects_and_Events\"></a><h1>Major Projects and Events</h1>\n<p>The information below is relayed on the CCP-AU website for further inquiry.

The CCP-AU mobilizes and disburses funds and other resources to enable African CSOs to participate in Continental CSO Conferences organized by the Centre. \n</p>\n<a id=\"Publications\" name=\"Publications\"></a><h1>Publications</h1>\n<p>\tThe main publications from the CCP-AU are the most recent reports from the Citizens\u2019 Continental Conferences for the African Union as well a report of the Continental Civil Society Conference on the Proposed African Union Government. These publications can be found on the website, <a href=\"http://www.ccpau.org\">www.ccpau.org</a>.

The organization allows citizens of the AU to gather and deliberate about issues that need attention or policy amendment. In addition, the CCP-AU attempts to inform and educate the citizens of the continent through their organization techniques and strategies such as sending updates to registered members of the organization, informing the public of decisions being made on key current issues or national affairs. Most importantly, the five main themes prevalent to concerns within the continent are focused on by the CCP-AU, therefore keeping the continents entire well being in consideration. Since the CCP-AU is one of the few organizations supporting citizen participation, its creation has been a crucial stepping-stone for the AU. The CCP-AU has proven to be a highly deliberative organization through its strategies, activities, and major events. \n</p><p>In terms of the analytic processes of deliberation, the CCP-AU has several strong points. Primarily, the CCP-AU has demonstrated to be very thorough at prioritizing key vales at stake. Through its training workshops, conferences, and overall function, the organization is incredibly skilled and equipped in identifying the key public concerns behind the surface facts and events that define an issue. Moreover, the CCP-AU gathers a group of people with a variety of perspectives to carefully examine and deliberate over the most important issues in the African Union, eventually to arrive well reasoned suggestions for improvements. For example, in the conference the CCP-AU organizes bi-annually, equal amounts of people are invited from each of the five regions of the continent in order to ensure diverse viewpoints. In this way the broadest possible range of solutions for solutions to problems are addressed by a large group that may have varying viewpoints. \n</p><p>The CCP-AU also effectively addresses several aspects of the social process for deliberation. For example, the organizations web site makes news and information understandable for readers since each event or publication the CCP-AU is involved with has an external link to more news resources. Also, with the use of diverse sources in their activities and major events (including diverse participants from all different parts of the continent with different backgrounds and perspectives), the CCP-AU reaches beyond conventional debates and discussion. There is therefore time for everyone to seek out other view points and voices in order to arrive at their own personal best decision. \n</p><p>However, there are still a few unclear elements in the CCP-AU. Primarily, the annual budget and how the CCP-AU raises its funding is undisclosed. It is also vague as to how many members are apart of the organization, and their demographic location. Lastly, if the web site was more properly configured with transparent information, then it would be more deliberatively effective. \n</p>\n<a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a><h1>References</h1>\n<p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx\">http://www.ccpau.org/Home/tabid/36/language/en-US/Default.aspx</a>\n</p><p>\n</p>\n<a id=\"Secondary_Literature\" name=\"Secondary_Literature\"></a><h1>Secondary Literature</h1>\n<p>Chitiga, Rudo, Bronwen Manby, and Irungu Houghton.

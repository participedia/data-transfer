{"htmlbody": "<h3>Background:</h3><p>In January of 1995, greater Kobe, Japan experienced a high intensity earthquake called the Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake.\u00a0 The damage extended into Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyogo.\u00a0 Just in Hyogo alone, over 240,000 homes burned or collapsed as a result.\u00a0 In March of 1995, the City of Kobe local government issued plans for \u201cDesignation of Land Readjustment and Redevelopment Areas,\u201d which called for six areas of land readjustment and two areas to be redeveloped inside Kobe.\u00a0 The City of Kobe also divided the affected areas into black, gray and white zones, referring to the government-determined degree of necessary rehabilitation.\u00a0 Black zones needed the most amount of attention and rebuilding as a result of the severe earthquake; gray zones required rebuilding and had significant damage, but less so than the most severely impacted areas; and white zones experienced minimal damage and needed much less work than other areas of greater Kobe.\u00a0</p><h3>The Problems and Purpose:</h3><p>These plans created controversy between the residents and the local government, because the plans called for residents to lose their family inherited and owned properties.\u00a0 The government also made their decisions for rehabilitation without negotiating or consulting with residents whom the plans would impact.\u00a0 The City of Kobe administration also only allowed two weeks time for public inspection and objection to the plans before they would begin to be implemented.\u00a0 These two aspects clearly communicated to residents that the government had little willingness to change their agenda for the city.\u00a0</p><p>Machizukuri citizen groups were used as part of the Kobe rehabilitation process, such as in Rokko, Japan in the North District. \u00a0Machizukuri has existed in Japan since the 1960s and was used to engage residents in bettering their own communities, and to engage in dialogue with the local government in order to create accountability.\u00a0 The Japanese term <em>Machizukuri</em> translates to mean <em>town or community building process</em>.\u00a0 \u201cA machizukuri council [discusses] the context of an urban plan with the aid of professional consultants and put forth their proposal to the city authorities, which carry out the plan taking the proposal into consideration.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\" id=\"_ftnref\" name=\"_ftnref\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\u00a0 The essential pillars of Machizukuri were to bond, bridge, and link social capital; in other words, to create community unity, a multi- social sector network, and to get involved in government decision-making.\u00a0 Within this structure, the concept of a town meeting, deliberation, consensus building, negotiation, information and opinion sharing, and local leadership are also fundamental aspects of the best functioning citizen participation examples.\u00a0 This case study discusses how the North District (Rokko) used Machizukuri to impact the local government\u2019s community plans and establish its own initiative in the 1990s.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref\" id=\"_ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>Moriaki Hirohara &amp; Yoshimitsu Shiozaki, <em>VIII.

Their simple goal was to increase community involvement with the intention of stopping the local government from implementing the plans the public was excluded from.\u00a0 The government plans included improving the layout of the district by creating a large park composed of land to be redistributed from residents\u2019 properties.\u00a0 However, in May of 1996 the Council negotiated to reduce the size of the park in order to preserve as much private property of residents as possible.\u00a0</p><p>There was a total of eight Machizukuri Councils that developed in the district and these eight councils developed into the Joint Machizukuri Council, which deliberated issues common to the whole North District.\u00a0 In February of 1997, five committees developed specifically for dealing with common issues and areas needing attention throughout the district.\u00a0 These committees - made up of residents from the area - focused on reconstructing homes, preventing disasters, caring for the live environment, tending to roads and open spaces, and parks.</p><p>In May of 1998, the Committee to Organize the Neighborhood Association developed.\u00a0 Even after the period of earthquake recuperation was coming to a close, the Machizukuri Council remained established and active in the form of a neighborhood association, with the five subcommittees intact.\u00a0 More than half of the Neighborhood Association (NA) leaders were also members from the previous Machizukuri Council who volunteered to participate in the NA.\u00a0 In August of 1998 the Rokkomichi Station North District Park Management Group developed by the initiative of citizens in order to manage park maintenance.\u00a0 Over 4 years, more than 5,000 residents joined the Group and participated in the development and upkeep of local parks. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection:</h3><p>The main participants in North District rehabilitation and in the Machizukuri process were community members - residents of the area who self-selected themselves because of incentive or interest to contribute to one of the organizations.\u00a0 These people had interest and incentive to be active within Machizukuri because of their concern with the redevelopment of the area, that would otherwise be determined solely by the local government.\u00a0 Local government officials from the City of Kobe were also key players in rebuilding the greater Kobe area because of their role in reviewing and making proposals, and ultimately enacting significant rebuilding projects.\u00a0 Within the Machizukuri Councils and organizations, consultants, advisors and experts with a background in city planning and building aided residents in formulating plans to be proposed to the City of Kobe for development.\u00a0 The consultants and advisors\u2019 services and advice was requested in some cases by the Kobe local government, and was sought in others by the community residents themselves. \u00a0</p><p>Citizen selection was in part done by the self-selection and in part by the district of their residence.\u00a0 Participant selection was also determined by the degree to which the earthquake impacted one\u2019s community, and even more specifically one\u2019s home and work place.\u00a0 This is a matter of relevance.\u00a0 Therefore, the potential impact of rehabilitation plans and what those plans might imply was another motivating factor for residents to participate in Machizukuri organizations and NAs.\u00a0 In some areas of Kobe, the local government was the body that initiated Machizukuri organization.\u00a0 However, in some areas such as Rokko in the North District, residents themselves initiated and developed Machizukuri as a form of self-help.\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects:</h3><p>The Machizukuri method within Rokko has had mainly four positive outcomes as a result of its role in recuperation after the earthquake.\u00a0 Firstly, residents who chose to participate in the Machizukuri structure and the Neighborhood Association educated themselves through research and deliberation with other residents to develop their own plans for the area, in order to promote more citizen- local government interaction and prevent the City of Kobe from enforcing changes without citizen input.\u00a0 With the widespread and consistent use of discussion between diverse residents, more information was spread, better community improvement ideas were formulated and shared, and cooperation among participants was better supported.\u00a0 Secondly, the presence of active resident-led Machizukuri organizations increased citizen interest and involvement in Neighborhood Associations to further community development.\u00a0 People who would not have normally been involved in or aware of community matters were, and residents even held local leadership positions.\u00a0 Thirdly, citizen committees and organizations formed for the purposes of community betterment.\u00a0 And before the rehabilitation project and Machizukuri organization within the district, there was not a network of community organizations or committees with different focuses on common district issues.\u00a0 Finally, before the earthquake, the information sharing and decision making process was a top-down approach.\u00a0 This meant that information came from the local government and was passed on to the few neighborhood associations and then to the residents through the NAs.\u00a0 After the application of Machizukuri following the great earthquake, a bottom-up approach became more dominant, where residents played more of an active role in sharing information with each other and in problem solving within the NA and Machizukuri outlets.\u00a0 Then these bodies would make proposals to the local government.\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism:</h3><p>There were three main challenges that accompanied the application of Machizukuri organization.\u00a0 The first was a lack of citizen interest or active participation in deliberation, information sharing, and in creating development proposals.\u00a0 This lack of interest and participation was common in rural areas and white zones where earthquake damage was minimal, and where there was distance between neighbors and properties.\u00a0 A second challenge was the possibility for long negotiations and resistance between community members in Machizukuri organizations and the local government.\u00a0 Thirdly, productivity and the speed of proposal acceptance and implementation could vary by community.\u00a0 While these three potential challenges were found amongst greater Kobe Machizukuri groups, it is unclear from the secondary sources used to present this case study whether or not Rokko\u2019s Machizukuri experienced these setbacks.\u00a0 There are also unanswered questions about the logistics of sustaining citizen participation and their influence through Machizukuri; such as funds, a central meeting location, the number of residents and experts who regularly participated in the Council and committees established, and how they communicated effectively with local government officials.\u00a0 It is very clear that Machizukuri in Rokko had a positive impact on the opportunities available for local citizens to participate in managing their own community and increased engagement through these venues.\u00a0 However, what remains in question is whether or not the use of Machizukuri and related methods helped the citizens of the North District actually achieve their main goal: to prevent the local government from implementing its Kobe rehabilitation plans without public input or approval, and to allow residents to create and have implemented their own cohesive redevelopment plans.\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources:</h3><p>Healey, Patsy. \"Developing Neighbourhood Management Capacity in Kobe, Japan: Interactions\u00a0Between Civil Society and Formal Planning

This database provides information on all statewide initiatives adopted by voters in the United States from the first successful statewide initiative in 1904 through 2010. It allows users to sort voter-approved initiatives by year, state, subject category, and more, and to export data in a variety of forms to meet their research needs.</p><p>Originally developed by Dr. Ken Miller of Claremont McKenna College and student researchers as the empirical basis for Dr. Miller\u2019s book Direct Democracy and the Courts, the database supplements the book and provides a resource for researchers and others interested in the development and use of the initiative process. The database is maintained at the Rose Institute of State and Local Government.</p><p><a href=\"/methods/direct-democracy\" title=\"Direct Democracy\">Direct_Democracy</a> organisations present on Participedia</p>", "title": "Miller-Rose Institute Initiative Database"}

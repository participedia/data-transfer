Since their introduction, CCs have been held almost monthly. Any member of the public is able to register to attend a CC meeting, and the Prime Minister selects which ministers also attend each CC. Every CC meeting consists of three parts. The first part (lasting approximately 60 minutes) involves each attending minister holding up to five 10-minute meetings with individuals or small groups. The second is a 30-minute \u201ccommunity reception\u201d where light refreshments are providing to community attendees. The third and final part is a public forum (lasting approximately 45-60 minutes) where community members are able to post questions directly to the Prime Minister and attending ministers.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Chris Lewis and David Marsh (2012). \u201cNetwork Governance and Public Participation in Policy-Making: Federal Community Cabinets in Australia,\u201d <em>Australian Journal of Public Administration</em>, 71: 1, 6\u201319.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.dpmc.gov.au/community_cabinet/whatis.cfm\"><u>http://www.dpmc.gov.au/community_cabinet/whatis.cfm</u></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dpmc.gov.au/community_cabinet/meetings/index.cfm\"><u>http://www.dpmc.gov.au/community_cabinet/meetings/index.cfm</u></a></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Federal Community Cabinets (Australia)"}

In this climate, Participatory Budgeting in New York City (PBNYC), for Fiscal Year (2012-2013) is the largest pilot program of Participatory Budgeting to be implemented in the United States. \u00a0PBNYC aims to bring about greater transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement into the New York budgeting process with the dual aims of 1) having citizens directly create and vote upon projects and 2) bring about greater civic awareness and ultimately putting pressure for a more transparent budgeting process.</p><h3>History</h3><p>While Participatory Budgeting has proven to be a successful model for citizen engagement throughout the world, starting in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989, it has yet to take hold in the United States (Fung 2011).\u00a0 Since starting in Brazil, PB has expanded to more than 300 municipalities worldwide (Cabannes n.d.; Wampler 2004; Wampler and Avritzer 2005).\u00a0 The only other instance of PB in the United States is in the 49th Ward of Chicago. PB is a generative process that can take many forms depending on the size of the political unit to which it is applied. PB is inextricably linked to the given political structure that empowers PB--i.e., city level, state-wide level, etc.\u00a0 For example, the 1988 Brazilian Constitution set up the structural spaces in which PB could flourish (Baiocchi et al. 2011, p. 39).</p><p>While it is often recognized that PB has large potential and impact in the developing world, it is less clear if PB is a transferable model for the United States.\u00a0 Writing in a recent World Bank Organization report about PB, expert Brian Wampler notes \u201cone of the reasons why participatory budgeting is transferable to other locations, especially in developing countries, is that clientelism and social exclusion are everyday realities in many part of the developing world\u201d (Shah 2007)<strong>.</strong></p><p>When discussing Participatory Budgeting (PB) it is important to distinguish the many types of participatory democratic innovations, some even involving budgeting, from the specific form of PB understood as Brazilian Participatory Budgeting style that first took this form in Brazil in 1989.</p><p>In Brazil, the Workers Party (PT) is a democratic socialist party, which used PB as a way to mobilize citizens and win popular support and legitimacy.\u00a0 Motivations for implementing PB in the United States are different as the U.S. has disparate political and social environment than Brazil.\u00a0Joe Moore, Alderman of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/chicago-participatory-budgeting-project\">Chicago\u2019s 49th </a>District, was the first to ever implement PB in the United States.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>PBNYC was co-chaired by two organizations, <a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/\">Participatory Budget Project\u00a0</a>(PBP) and <a href=\"http://www.cvhaction.org/\">Community Voices Heard</a> (CVH). \u00a0These organizations co-chaired the City Wide Steering Committee comprised of representatives from the four council member districts participating as well as representatives from differenct community based organizations (CBOs) in New York City. Additionally, each district was comprised of a District Steering Committee comprised of citizens and representatives from local organizations and civic associations within each of the four districts.</p><p>The council member's offices provided funding for the process, some of it directly, some through in-kind donations, and some channeled through CVH through the expense fund process. \u00a0The process received outside grant and donor support. \u00a0Though notably the research and evaluation team, run through the <a href=\"http://www.urbanjustice.org/ujc/projects/sex.html\">Urban Justice Center (</a>UJC) lacked specific monies to run the process. \u00a0The process also received around $200,000 less than anticapted to run the process, therefore the majority of staff on the governance level were donating their time and resources to staff and run PBNYC.</p><p>Four council members in New York City signed up to use their discretionary capital funds for participatory budgeting for Fiscal Year 2012-2013. \u00a0The pilot program ran through August 2011- March 2012. The four council members who signed up to use their discretionary funds were: D8 Melissa Mark-Viverito (Manhattan/Bronx), D32 Eric Ulrich (Queens), D39 Brad Lander (Brooklyn) and D45 Jumaane Williams (Brooklyn). \u00a0The council members each pledges at least $1.4 million in discretionary capital funds that can be put toward infrastructural projects. For the second year, Fiscal Year 2013-2014, four additional council members have signed up for a total of $15 million in discretionary funds to be allocated through the PB process.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The process began in September 2011 with the final vote in March 2012.\u00a0 The process began with district information sessions in which community members, leaders, and civil society organizations came together to learn more about the process and volunteer to serve on the District Steering Committees.\u00a0 The District Steering Committees helped to divide each district into Neighborhoods, which hosted a first round of Neighborhood Assemblies in October 2011.\u00a0 At these events community members learned about the process and broke up into smaller groups to brainstorm potential projects in their neighborhoods - there are four or five neighborhoods within each district.\u00a0 At these neighborhood assemblies people signed up to be Budget Delegates \u2013 the people who met between November and February to actually create and draft proposals.\u00a0 You did not need to be a resident of a given district to come to a Neighborhood Assembly or serve as a budget delegate. \u00a0You did need to be a resident in the community in order to vote; however, the vote is open to all people aged over 18 including non-citizens.\u00a0</p><p>Budget Delegates worked directly with city agencies in the specific thematic committiess such as Transporation, Parks and Recreation, and Education etc. and draft these proposals.\u00a0 In February 2012 a second round of Neighborhood Assemblies took place in which people deliberated, discussed, and commented on the proposals.\u00a0 After these revisions there was a community-wide vote in March 2012 for projects. \u00a0Council Members pledged to fund at least $1 million dollars in projects. As outlined below, Council member Lander ended up putting over $5 million to fund PBNYC projects. \u00a0 Additionally, Council Members have pledged to try to find other revenue streams, including expense funds, to fund additional project ideas beyond those that were voted upon which proved true during the course of the process.</p><h2>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h2><p>Throughout the various stages of the process there were moments and opportunities for deliberation, decisions, and public interaction. The District Committe members decided where to hold all events and worked directly with the Council Members' offices to publicize events. At the first round of Neighborhood Assemblies, Council Members were present, speaking, and interacting directly with residents and stakeholders in the community. \u00a0These were opportunities to meet new people neighborhoods and discuss both the common and disparate themes and problems. \u00a0In the first round of Neighborhood Assemblies citizens deliberated and drew up project proposals. \u00a0There was a wide exchange of ideas as they brainstorm edall the different parts of their communities where they wanted to see capital improvements made.</p><p>The list of projects from these first round of Neighborhood Assemblies were consolidated and then presented to the people who signed up to be Budget Delegates. \u00a0Each Budget Delegate group was divided by theme based on the project proposals from each district's compilation of Neighborhood Assemblies, for example Parks and Recreation and Transporation. \u00a0Each Budget Delegate committee has a faciliator who is either trained as a moderator or already serving on the District Committee. \u00a0At these committees, experts from the specific government agencies involved in the projects for example if a project is about Education a staff member from the Education Department attended, and consulted the delegates in the process. \u00a0The Council member offices serves as an intermediary between Budget Delegates and City agencies.\u00a0</p><p>The bulk of deliberation and discussion took place in the Budget Delegate theme groups as they were typically comprised of a small enough number of people to enable true discussion and deliberation. \u00a0Some theme groups had subcommittees within the committee, such as Streets and Sidewalks subscomittee within the broader Parks and Recreations committee. \u00a0Budget Delegates met roughly every other week over a span of many months and often communicated through email and phone. \u00a0Therefore there are many different opportunities for deliberation, engagement, and discussion. \u00a0The level of online interaction varied through the districts with D-39 and D-8 using online tools the most for the process. \u00a0In D-39, 180 project proposals were submitted online; 40 in D-8; 17 in D-45, and 8 in D-32. \u00a0D-45, D-8 and D-39 all use social media as part of their project Council member communication strategy including facebook, twitter, and blogs. \u00a0The various demographics within each district and Council member capacity with technology influenced the usage of Internet Communication Technoogies (ICT) in PBNYC. \u00a0Overall, the process was extremely \"low tech.\"</p><h2>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h2><h4>Preliminary Budget Options from the Votes:</h4><p><em><u>District 39: \u00a02,200 Voters Total $1.4 Million</u></em></p><ol><li>Renovation of two\u00a0dysfunctional bathrooms at PS 124\u00a0($150,000, 958 votes)</li><li>Innovative\u00a0community composting system\u00a0near Gowanus Canal to turn 1 ton/day of food waste into soil ($165,000, 919 votes)</li><li>Planting 100 new trees\u00a0on blocks throughout the district with few or no trees ($100,000, 767 votes)</li><li>New technology for PS 130 and PS 154\u00a0($140,000, 758 votes)</li><li>Repairing\u00a0Prospect Park pedestrian paths\u00a0to prevent flooding, and adding trash cans in the park ($205,000, 648 votes)</li><li>Repairs and safety improvements at the dangerous\u00a0Prospect Expressway/Church Avenue\u00a0pedestrian crossing ($200,000, 606 votes)</li><li>New books and equipment for the\u00a0Kensington public library\u00a0to enhance the branch\u2019s use for meetings, storytelling, rehearsals, and small performances promoting Kensington's cultural diversity ($80,000, 582 votes)</li></ol><p><em><u>District 8:\u00a01,132 Voters Total $1.54 Million</u></em></p><ol><li>Transportation for Seniors and Meals-on-Wheels Delivery Van ($100,000) - 579 votes. \u00a0The transportation and Meals-on-Wheels vans will be operated by Union Settlement Association</li><li>Security Cameras in Several NYCHA Developments ($525,000) - 499 votes. \u00a0Includes Jefferson, Johnson, Betances, Millbrook, Washington, Taft, Clinton, &amp;

Do the motivations of council members even matter? Is this process about bringing people to vote for projects and building coaltions around their Council members or to form deeper civic associations and bonds? If the project is ambitiously aiming to do all of these things how can they be achieved with substantative political and capital resources?\u00a0</p><p>While the first cycle of participation has come to a close, there is concern about the ability of citizens to effectively monitor the projects implemented. \u00a0PB in the United States has not used <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/coleman/2012/06/19/ict4gov-improving-governance-through-technology/\">Internet Communication Technologies (ICT) as effectively as PB </a>in some other places, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic. \u00a0Therefore, the question remains as to which tools participants will use to follow up on project monitoring and implementation.\u00a0</p><p>Lastly, there is the challenge of how to turn PBNYC into a process that calls for greater transparency and accountability for larger sums of money. \u00a0The Participatory Budget Project co-Founder and Brown Professor Gianpaolo Baiocchi notes that \"The challenge is to use the discretionary funds as a stepping stone towards other kinds of decision-making. Imagine how transformative it would be to actually control the way the city works and runs!\"</p><h3>\u00a0</h3><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf\">http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgetin...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/nyregion/for-some-new-yorkers-a-grand-experiment-in-participatory-budgeting.html?_r=4&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion\">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/nyregion/for-some-new-yorkers-a-grand-...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/nyregion/voters-speak-in-budget-experiment-saying-yes-to-bathrooms.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion\">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/nyregion/voters-speak-in-budget-experi...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/coleman/2012/06/19/ict4gov-improving-governance-through-technology/\">http://blogs.cfr.org/coleman/2012/06/19/ict4gov-improving-governance-thr...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/nyregion/christine-quinn-uses-council-funds-to-reward-allies.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/nyregion/christine-quinn-uses-council-...</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://labs.council.nyc/pb/\">Official PBNYC Website</a></p><p><a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf\">Participatory Budgeting - The World Bank\u00a0</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.socialinnovation.ash.harvard.edu/hollie-russon-gilman-largest-participatory-budgeting-experiment-in-the-u-s-underway-in-nyc.html\">Harvard Social Innovators Blog - \"Largest Participatory Budgeting Experiment Underway in NYC\"</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/167406/participatory-budgeting-hits-new-york-city\">The Nation - \"Participatory Budgeting hits New York City\"</a></p><p><a href=\"http://socialinnovation.ash.harvard.edu/milestone-for-nycs-experiment-in-participatory-budgeting\">http://socialinnovation.ash.harvard.edu/milestone-for-nycs-experiment-in...</a> [BROKEN LINK]</p>", "title": "Participatory Budgeting (New York, New York)"}

But to be truly valuable and to ensure that the <a href=\"/wiki/Citizens%27_Jury\" title=\"Citizens' Jury\">Citizens'_Jury</a> succesfully influences policy, it must be set up with painstaking efforts to ensure its integrity, inclusiveness and credibility.</p><p>In any given society it is important to ask whose perspectives, knowledge and aspirations are embedded in policies, and whose are excluded. Recognising that policies usually reflect and reinforce the interests of the powerful, citizens\u2019 juries are attempts to foster greater inclusion and democratic pluralism in policy making.</p><p>This project page sheds light on the process of policy making and how a citizens\u2019 jury can influence it. It looks at the policy impacts of two citizens\u2019 juries and highlights the factors which enabled civil society empowerment to change policy.</p><p><a id=\"\" name=\"\"></a></p><h2>See also\u00a0: </h2><p>1. special issue of the journal <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.planotes.org/pla_backissues/40.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.planotes.org/pla_backissues/40.html\">Participatory Learning and Action (PLA)</a> on Deliberative Democracy and Citizen Empowerment, edited by Tom Wakeford and Michel Pimbert \u2013 see contents page of this Special issue and articles 5. onwards</p><p>2.

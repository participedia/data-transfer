{"htmlbody": "<p>The Socialist Party has governed the city of Rosario since 1989. The fact that the Socialist Party has stayed in power for so long is indicative of a path that the city has been following for 20 years. Based on the vision of a long term colective project, the city council is constantly developing policies oriented to the construction of citizenship, the strenghthening of rights and the promotion of equality and inclusion. The implementation of the Participatory Budgeting in 2002 laid the foundations for a new civic culture in Rosario, with very significant results for the city. The local government opens this space in order to orient public expenditure towards the real necessities of male and female citizens and to strengthen a democratic, efficient and transparent state.</p>", "title": "City of Rosario (Argentina)"}

{"htmlbody": "<p>Preparing a write-up of this case will require knowledge of Portuguese (PBcensus 1 - complete raw data). Although there are no existing case studies in English on Aracaju, the city was surveyed in the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census\">Participatory Budgeting Census 2012</a> (Spada et al. 2012). Thus, many of the fixed data fields provided by Participedia are complete.

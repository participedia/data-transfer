Through it's diverse projects, Z communications is able to pursue its central focus -- the communication of ideas, information, and inspiration essential to activist motivation and success. Z\u2019s projects include <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zmag\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zmag\">Z Magazine</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/znet\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/znet\">ZNet</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zspace\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zspace\">ZSpace</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zmi/zmiapplication.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zmi/zmiapplication.htm\">Z Media Institute</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zvideo/main\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zcommunications.org/zvideo/main\">Z Video Productions</a>, and more.</p><p>Z Communications receives regular contributions by notable Leftists such as Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman, Amy Goodman, John Pilger, Arundhati Roy, Bill Fletcher, Phyliss Bennis, Robin Hahnel, Tariq Ali, Michael Albert, and many others.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Mission\" name=\"Mission\"></a></p><h2>Mission</h2><p>Z Communications assists social movements in their struggle to improve people's lives in the present context while planting the seeds for a more just and equitable future by providing content that critiques today's reality and envisions tomorrow's via our print, video, online, audio, and direct interactions, such as ZMI.</p><p>A notable aspect of our mission is an approach that does not privilege any one side of life over the rest. ZCom is about race, gender, power, class, ecology, and peace - it is about justice in all conceivable forms -- seeing each as intimately entwined with and certainly in no sense prior to or alone causal of the rest.</p><p>A second notable aspect is a commitment to fundamental transformation and two implications that stem from that commitment. First, ZCom highlights that successful action in the present depends very much not only on understanding current conditions but also on broad clarity about future goals and building links between the two. A priority of ZCom is therefore vision and strategy regarding all sides of life. Second, however, ZCom is convinced that a movement able to transform society requires massive, highly informed, participatory, unwavering allegiance which will only grow and persist if the seeds of a better future are embodied in the actions of current activists.</p><p>When South End Press was born in the late 1970s, and when Z Magazine spun off ten years later, and in all the innovations since then leading to ZNet, ZVideo, and ZMI, and now to ZCom and its new ZSpace, there has been continuity.</p><p>Our mission is to help improve life via social struggle that builds growing commitment and organization informed by understanding existing conditions and shared vision of future improvement, fueled by personal and structural solidarity, by personal and collective desire, and by personal and rational hope.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>South End Press (1978) was founded to raise consciousness about class, gender, race, and power and to provide information, analysis, and vision to help activism. Z Magazine (1987) aimed to bring more diverse information more often and to increase the visibility of writers and illustrators. In ZCom, we added ZNet and ZTranslations, ZMI, ZVideo, and most recently ZEO and ZSpace including ZBlogs and ZForums.</p><p>Z Magazine was founded by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent. Lydia in turn initiated ZVideo and works overwhelmingly on ZMag and ZVideo. Michael initiated ZNet and works overwhelmingly on web operations. Eric Sargent joined in the late 1980s and works on Z Magazine and ZVideo. Andy Dunn (ZMI 2000) joined in 2005 and works on Z Magazine and ZVideo. Chris Spannos (ZMI 2001) joined in 2006, working on ZNet. Everyone works on ZMI.</p><p>ZCom also gets volunteer help. Brian Dominick (ZMI 1999) helped design and program ZNet. Justin Podur and Stephen Shalom have assisted editorially for years. Other volunteers work on some watch pages and especially and with great devotion and energy on Z Translations.</p><p>The online operations have been through many incarnations. Originally Left Bulletin Board System (PBBS), they morphed into Left On Line, ZNet, and finally ZCom. Even ZCom has itself had lifetimes, already - two major makeovers, among other changes brought us to the current situation in which now, to ZNet, ZMag, ZVideo, and and ZMI, we add ZSpace.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Alternative_to_Corporate_Media\" name=\"Alternative_to_Corporate_Media\"></a></p><h2>Alternative to Corporate Media</h2><p>Z receives zero financial support from corporate sponsors. Instead, Z relies on support from its users, readers, listeners, etc. Through the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.zcommunications.org/zsustainers/signup\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.zcommunications.org/zsustainers/signup\">ZSustainer Program</a>, users sign up to donate on a monthly, quarterly, bi annually, or annually schedule an amount of their own choosing (privacy policy available here).

It gives participants blogs, forums, uploading capability for quotes, lyrics, graphics, poetry, and articles. It culls user preferences creating a database of information and reviews about books, films, and links.

Videos are sold in the ZStore and there are discounts, often very deep discounts, for Sustainers. We also have numerous videos explicitly for online viewing, mostly excerpts from ZVideos, but sometimes created in whole for the purpose. Links and viewing tools for these are available throughout the site, as well as on the ZVideo pages, per se.

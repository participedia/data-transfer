{"htmlbody": "<p>The League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan political organization, established in 1920 to rework and improve the structure of government and benefit public policies by educating and engaging American citizens in public advocacy. The League of Women Voters is a grassroots organization composed of the people and operates on a National, State, and Local level. There are leagues represented in all fifty states, in addition to many local leagues across the globe. There are approximately 150,000 members nationwide (as of 2006). The League of Women voters operates on a national level with grassroots support from state and local leagues. <a href=\"#cite_note-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a id=\"Purpose_and_Mission\" name=\"Purpose_and_Mission\"></a></p><h2>Purpose and Mission</h2><p>The league of women voters does not support or oppose candidates at any level of government participation. The league, however, is very political, striving to \u201cinfluence policy through advocacy\u201d and declaring their support or opposition of political issues (after examining them and reaching a consensus on a position. The league is described as the \u201coriginal grassroots citizen network\u201d and is directed by the general consensus of its members nationwide (900 state and local league). The league strives to enhance comprehension of major public policy issues through education and advocacy, along with lobbying in congress. The incumbent president of the League is Elisabeth MacNamara and Nancy E. Tate is the Executive Director. <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Carrie Chapman Catt founded the league in 1920 in Chicago in the wake of the final meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The establishment of the league was roughly six month prior to the Ninetieth amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. Maud Wood Park was the first president. Initially, the organization strived to help newly enfranchised women become familiar with the voting process; such as where to register, how to assess candidate and ballot information, and what to do at the polling boxes. <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Though the organization was composed of women the league did not want its activities to be confined to women\u2019s issues. The three chief aims of the organization were to: 1. Complete enfranchisement of all women, 2. To remove all legal discrimination against women, 3.to make democracy safe so that every citizen feels secure and other nations acknowledge the United States as legitimate. <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a> The league was divided into seven regions with regional directors and officers in addition to an overarching board of directors and a president (Maud Wood Park). In the league third year it took global initiative by inviting representatives from Latin American nations to participate in a pan American conference of women. In 1973, the league allowed males to join. Prior to this it was an all female organization. One of the first bills the league endorsed was the Sheppard-Towner Act in 1921, which provided federal aid for maternal and child care programs. This was the leagues first effective use of grassroots organization and active citizen education to organize participants into action. <a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a> In 1930, the league fought to solve a government corruption issue; hundreds of federal employees were politically supported in their government jobs. The league endorsed the merit system, which would base merit on the individual\u2019s qualifications. This system would attempt to stop the government practice of giving federal jobs under the \u201cSpoils System.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-5\" title=\"\">[6]</a> The league was successful in helping to reduce this practice and in 1938 the Bill was passed which placed jobs under civil service. The league became more environmentally oriented in 1933 when they supported a legislation to develop The Tennessee River basin, the site of a publically owned power facility. The league continued their environmental pursuits by working to enact and implement the clean air act and the clean water act. The league also focused on the lack of public transportation and ways to promote conservation. In 1960 and 70s the league focused more on basic human rights, such as the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The league focused its efforts on the 1980s Roe v. Wade Case, which granted women the constitutional right to make reproductive choices. In the 1990s the league refined their education fund by established a project to help guide civic education of women in emerging democracies. During this time the league worked to help register more Americans to vote by passing the national voter registration act. This act would help clarify the registration process and improve and reshape the position the government plays in the registration process. Currently, the league is working on health care reforms, effective gun control, and finance reforms. <a href=\"#cite_note-6\" title=\"\">[7]</a></p><p><a id=\"Current_issues\" name=\"Current_issues\"></a></p><h2>Current issues</h2><p>The leagues issues can be categorized into four categories of activity; representative government, international relations, natural resources, and social policy.</p><p><a id=\"Representative_government\" name=\"Representative_government\"></a></p><h3>Representative government</h3><p>\u201cPromote an open governmental system that is representative, accountable and responsive.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-7\" title=\"\">[8]</a></p><p><a id=\"Campaign_finance\" name=\"Campaign_finance\"></a>Campaign finance</p><p>In the 2008 presidential campaign, the league urged candidates to back the reform to the Presidential Public Financing System and legislation to fix public financing systems for the president, in addition to establishing a congressional public financing for the first time. <a href=\"#cite_note-8\" title=\"\">[9]</a></p><p><a id=\"Citizen_Participation\" name=\"Citizen_Participation\"></a>Citizen Participation</p><p>In the 109th Congress the League supported The Openness Promoted Effectiveness in our National Government Act.

{"htmlbody": "<p>The Harrow Open Budget was a part of the Power Inquiry, rather than responding to its recommendations. \u00a0One of the Councillors at the time was part of that Inquiry. \u00a0The Harrow Open Budget process was championed by this Councillor and another independent Councillor, although it was supported by all three main political parties on Harrow Council at the time.</p><p>The Open Budget public meeting (which was open to all residents) was presented with choices for debate by Council Officers. \u00a0Councillors were not allowed to participate in this process, although this did observe it. \u00a0Having given their opinion on a range of issues, the Open Budget meeting elected about 20 people to 'monitor' how the Council responded to those recommendations. \u00a0In this sense there was no joint decision making: the objective was not so much 'participation' as 'holding elected Councillors to account'.</p>", "title": "Harrow Open Budget"}

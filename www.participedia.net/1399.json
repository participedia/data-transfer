{"htmlbody": "<h3>Summary</h3><p>In 2012 Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue service ran a Participatory Budgeting programme which distributed around \u00a320,000 in three communities. The aim of the activity was to carry out a series of PB pilots to see what the processes would offer a FRS as an engagement technique that could help improve community safety. The events made people aware of the importance of self-reliance / sufficiency and generated the realisation that community needs to do things themselves to help the level of resilience in their community. Increased awareness of different groups in the community to each other, what they do and how they can work together. DSFRS gained some useful and unexpected contacts with different groups. Demonstrates new direction to FRS as a truly local champion, gave development opportunities for staff, and had a positive impact on recipients.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Participatory Budgeting "}

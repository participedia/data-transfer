{"htmlbody": "<h3>Summary</h3><p>On June 26th, 2010 AmericaSpeaks held a National Town Meeting in 58 cities around the United States called Our Budget, Our Economy, where 3,500 Americans discussed possible solutions to America\u2019s long term fiscal challenges.</p><p>A preliminary analysis from the MacArthur Foundation said:<br/>\u201cThis event was meant to create a distinctive opportunity for ordinary Americans \u2013 not professional economists, policy makers, or political officials \u2013 to deliberate about these momentous choices according to their own values\u201d.<br/><br/>The National Town Meeting took place in 19 communities across the United States as well as 38 volunteer-organized \u201ccommunity conversations\u201d.\u00a0 The 19 communities had a diverse set of participants, ensured by AmericaSpeaks, where as the 38 community conversations were organized by volunteers and thus may not have had a representational set of participants. The 19 communities were as follows:\u00a0 Albuquerque, New Mexico; Augusta, Maine; Casper, Wyoming; Chicago, Illinois; Columbia, South Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Detroit, Michigan; East Palo Alto, California; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Jackson, Mississippi; Louisville, Kentucky; and Missoula, Montana.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The goal of the meeting was simple and straightforward: participants were asked to answer the question \u201cHow should America grapple with its growing national debt?\u201d \u00a0Over the course of the day Americans from all walks of life came together to discuss their values and come up with solutions to this problem.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The project was funded by grants from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. \u00a0The event was facilitated by AmericaSpeaks.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>AmericaSpeaks utilized several processes to ensure a diverse and representative set of participants.\u00a0 The organization set up a webpage where citizens who were interested in being involved in the discussion could register to participate.\u00a0 AmericaSpeaks also enlisted the help of local groups and grassroots organizations to ensure diverse participation in the specific locations of the deliberation and reach out to unaffiliated participants.\u00a0 In order to gather relevant information, the registration form for the event asked for the age, income, race, and party affiliation of each applicant.</p><p>The make-up of event participants is detailed under the \"Notes\" section below. In most cases, participants represented an accurate portrayal of United States demographics with a few exceptions.\u00a0 Hispanics were underrepresented.\u00a0 The average age of participants was skewed to be much older than the national average and there was a stronger liberal presence than a conservative one.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>On the day of the event, participants were seated randomly at small discussion tables with 8-10 participants and one facilitator per table.\u00a0 The facilitator was an experienced volunteer pre-screened by AmericaSpeaks.\u00a0 The event lasted for almost seven hours.\u00a0 The participants began by talking about values, economic recovery, and challenges to cutting the deficit.\u00a0</p><p>They then spent almost three hours learning about, discussing, and then voting on the 42 spending and revenue options provided them.\u00a0 These 42 policy options were given to the participants before the event along with background reading material.\u00a0 The options were drafted by 30 prominent fiscal experts that spanned the ideological range from liberal to conservative.\u00a0 The goal of the 42 options was to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion by 2025.\u00a0</p><p>While the groups were discussing, experts were available to answer questions and brief presentations by experts and Congressmen were given throughout the day.\u00a0 While these discussions occurred, table groups could submit ideas via laptops on each table.\u00a0 These ideas were then read and analyzed by a team of professional, deemed the \u201ctheme team\u201d, who looked for nation-wide themes.\u00a0 The theme team identified certain nation-wide themes and individuals used keypads to express their personal preference.\u00a0 Video links allowed participants at different sites to share ideas periodically.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of the day, participants developed messages to send to leaders in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Two popular messages included \u201cabandon the failed politics of partisanship\u201d and \u201cplease find the political will to use this input as if it were coming from a powerful lobbying group \u2013 because we are\u201d.\u00a0 Participants were asked to reflect on the tone and quality of the political discussion in our country today, as well as the tone and quality of the discussions at the Our Budget, Our Economy Town Meeting:</p><p><em>How satisfied are you with the tone and quality of our discussions here today?</em></p><p>Very Satisfied: 62%</p><p>Satisfied: 29%</p><p>Neutral: 6%</p><p>Dissatisfied: 2%</p><p>Very Dissatisfied: 1%</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>How satisfied are you with the tone and quality of political discussion in our country today?</em></p><p>Very Satisfied: 1%</p><p>Satisfied: 3%</p><p>Neutral: 8%</p><p>Dissatsified: 31%</p><p>Very Disatisfied: 58%</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Participants had this to say about their experiences:</p><p>\u201cThe most important thing I learned from this process is that ordinary citizens could tackle a complex issue, filter it civilly through their own perspective, and come up with consensus.\u00a0 I literally did not think this was possible\u201d. \u2013Fran G., Portland, OR</p><p>\u201cIt was so refreshing to have civil discourse among people of different ages, persuasions, and backgrounds.\u00a0 Congress could learn a lot from our experience.\u00a0 The tone of our discussions was polite, respectful, and everyone contributed.\u201d \u2013 MaryEllen S., Albuquerque, NM</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><ul><li>2/3 of table groups\u2019 final packages reduced the debt by more than $1 trillion.</li><li>Participants moderated their views and compromised: Conservatives became more supportive of raising taxes on wealthy.\u00a0 Liberals became more supportive of a 5% cut to discretionary programs.</li></ul><p>Input from the event was presented to President Obama\u2019s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</p><p>The individual survey responses from the day were highly structured by ideology, but the packages put together by the tables had a definite lack of ideological structure, suggesting compromise and creativity.\u00a0 When asked to discuss policies with their fellow citizens, participants tended to set aside their ideological commitments in order to work toward the common goal of fiscal responsibility and achieve the set task of reducing the national debt. \u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>This deliberative event shows that considered opinions are important.\u00a0 When national surveys poll citizen values, they do not take into account considered opinions that are important in the process of reaching a goal.\u00a0 Though citizens have priorities, they are often willing to compromise some of their priorities in favor of reaching a beneficial solution.</p><p>The MacArthur Foundation preliminary analysis found that this was the</p><p>\u201clargest national experiment in structured public deliberation to date in the United States and so constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to explore both public views about the substantive topic of public spending and more general questions about the dynamics of public deliberation\u201d.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a

PEP-NET includes public bodies, solution providers and citizen organizations as well as researchers and scientists. The network is open to all organizations willing and actively trying to advance the idea and use of eParticipation in Europe.</p><p>The project aims to help overcome fragmentation and promote best practice by connecting established and experienced eParticipation players and networks throughout Europe as a critical first step. The objective of this project is to achieve critical mass for the establishment of a Pan European eParticipation Network (PEP-NET). Such a network will act as a repository and disseminator of good practice and exchange of experience, and be a visible resource for all interested parties across the European Union.</p><p>PEP-NET ensures wider access to European eParticipation projects and permit more effective dialogue between eParticipation experts, researchers, practitioners, public administrations, civil society organisations and the interested public with the ultimate goal of facilitating knowledge transfer, encouraging further eParticipation trials and establishing European leadership in this field. To do so, PEP-NET seeks to showcase participatory technologies \u201cin action\u201d by leveraging the full potential of popular Web 2.0 and 3.0 tools such as:</p><p>\u2022Facebook</p><p>\u2022Twitter</p><p>\u2022YouTube</p><p>\u2022DIGG</p><p>PEP-NET uses these new social networking tools to increase the availability of ICT-based solutions for public participation, thereby helping to achieve one of the main objectives of the ICT PSP work programme.</p>", "title": "Pan-European e-Participation Network (PEP-NET)"}

They believe that today the challenges of democratic participation, social equality, and cultural innovation cannot be effectively understood and addressed at the nation state level.</p><p>The organisation sees itself as a breeding ground for new ideas and proposals for politics and culture at a European level and in being a political and cultural actor with a truly transeuropean activity, staff and support base.</p><p>The reflexion and action of European Alternatives is targeted in the first instance at the European Union and European nation states, but the political and cultural horizon of the organisation is global, as are the collaborations it tries to foster. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>Imagining Alternatives</p><p>\u2022 Research, publications, and transnational seminars to formulate, from the ground-up and through the participation of citizens and members of their local groups, a wide series of political proposals for the Europe to come.</p><p>\u2022 Transeuropa Festival an innovative simultanous festival taking place in 4 cities mixing cultural, political, and artistic engagement across borders.</p><p>\u2022 Artistic projects, such as the recent Polis21, inviting artists to imagine alternative proposals for society and political community.

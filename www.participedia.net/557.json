Thus the project was designed for citizens, city officials, and business people. It took place in the municipality of Casamassima, a small city with 18,000 inhabitants in the province of Bari in Puglia.\u00a0</p><p>The workshop revolved around the basic theme \u201cthe future of Casamassima\u201d which, to facilitate discussion, was divided into four sub-themes:</p><ul><li>wellness and quality of life</li><li>environment, city, and rural area</li><li>innovation, culture, and knowledge</li><li>economy and labour</li></ul><h3><strong>Sponsors and Financing</strong></h3><p>The Shop of the Future is part of the plan for \u201cReinforcement of the Administrative Capacity for a Quality Administration\u201d\u2014PON (Plan of National Organization) Governance and Systematic Actions, promised by the Department of Public Functions of the Ministry for Public Administration and Innovation.\u00a0 The project was carried out by Formez PA (center services, assistance, research, and training for the modernization of Public Administrations) with the collaboration of the municipality of Casamassima.\u00a0 The work was financed by European Structural Funds 2007-2013.</p><h3><strong>Methodology</strong></h3><p>The adopted methodology was the European Awareness Scenario Workshop (EASW), a discussion method built on two principles:\u00a0 the development of vision, in which the participants are invited to project themselves into the future to imagine which scenario they desire, and the proposal of ideas, in which the participants are called upon to propose ideas which could contribute to realization of the individual aspects of the common vision.\u00a0 The EASW is also structured for guiding participants; in fact, the use of this methodology allows for the exchange of opinions, the development of shared positions, and the proposition of solutions for overcoming encountered obstacles and seizing the opportunity.\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Duration and Location</strong></h3><p>The program was built to the needs of the project, keeping in mind the region\u2019s characteristics.\u00a0 For this reason, it was decided to divided the normal EASW program into three distinct meetings, in order to lessen the burden requested of participants. \u00a0The first meeting, on July 6th, 2010, had the goal of developing a vision.\u00a0 The second session, on July 18th, had the aim of formulating proposals of project ideas.\u00a0 Finally, the third meeting, held July 20th, saw the presentation of the ideas which emerged from the groups,\u00a0 which were put to a vote.\u00a0 The meetings were held in the open, in the atrium of the Monacelle Palace, a fifth century historic complex in the city center, in\u00a0 order to create the atmosphere of a public event open to the observation and curiosity of everyone, even those who did not participate.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Participants</strong></h3><p>Between 30 and 40 people take part in an EASW, and they need to be representative of the local community in which the workshop takes place.\u00a0 To achieve this goal, the involvement of four sectors was ensured:</p><ul><li>citizens and their organizations</li><li>representatives of the private sector:\u00a0 businesses and sectoral associations</li><li>experts and professionals</li><li>public administration officials</li></ul><p>To participate, it was necessary to enroll between July 6th and July 8th using a form attached to the letter of invitation. Flyers and brochures were also distributed in order to publicize the event.\u00a0 Thus, the group was self selected.\u00a0 The total number of participants amounted to 69 individuals.</p><h3><strong>Methods of Involvement</strong></h3><p>As mentioned above, the workshop was completed in three afternoon encounters over which the typical phases of EASW were distributed.\u00a0 Each session opened at 17:30 with the registration of the participants and the division into interest groups, and concluded at 20:30.\u00a0 The positive common vision which emerged from the workshop was one of a better city in which the wellness and quality of life were notably increased through the creation of well equipped green spaces, health care that meets the needs of persons at risk and disadvantaged groups, and facilitated through access to new technologies. The common vision of Casamassima was one in which a good balance between public and private interest offered citizens very efficient services.</p><p>The proposal from participants which received the most votes on the third day were:\u00a0 \u201cPaese Azzurro\u201d and \u201cEDOC.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPaese Azzurro\u201d was a proposal to revive the historic city center, with consequent positive economic impacts for tourism and cultural activities;\u00a0 \u201cEDOC\u201d was of a more strictly economic character, with the objective of spreading a new mode of agriculture through the promotion of an ethical pact among farmers, the creation of a quality market for local products, and, in order to revive the historic center, the installation of markets and shops inside.</p><h3><strong>Results</strong></h3><p>The event\u2019s results were drafted into a report detailing the activities. The participants who responded to an evaluation survey said that they were satisfied with the process, and the majority affirmed being ready to take part again in the future.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h3><p>Notwithstanding the high level of satisfaction of the participants, some aspects of the process appear problematic.\u00a0 The informational campaign, essential for the recruitment of participants, does not seem to have been sufficient in scale. The recruitment method did not allow for an adequate representation of the relevant population. Finally, the ultimate influence of the participatory process was not clear, although in this regard the fact should not be overlooked that, within a few months of the end of the process, Casamassima was <em>commissariato</em> (a process by which the government takes power away from the mayor usually for a major emergency or because of corruption).\u00a0</p><h3><strong>External Links</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://issuu.com/conetica/docs/bdf_report_finale_compresso\">Final Report</a></p><p><a href=\"http://pongas.formez.it/content/la-bottega-del-futuro-un-progetto-una-visione-condivisa-del-futuro-della-citt%C3%A0\">Formez PA Webpage Relating to the Event</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]\u00a0<br/>UPDATE: see <a href=\"http://partecipazione.formez.it/content/bottega-futuro-un-percorso-partecipato-migliorare-qualita-vita-nella-citta\">here</a>\u00a0for similar webpage</p>", "title": "Space of the Future (Casamassima, Italy) "}

{"htmlbody": "<p class=\"documentDescription\">In 2006 the Community Council in Coedpoeth used precept funds in a PB process. It was promoted by community groups and local leaders. A leaflet was distributed to all residents in the village informing them of the process and inviting them to a public meeting. Together Creating Communities, a broad based community organisation, together with Help the Aged and the Community Council in Coedpoeth all provided support.</p><p class=\"documentDescription\">This case study was originally submitted to the Participatory Budgeting Unit by the organisers of the project, using a template supplied by the PB Unit.</p><h3>Overview:</h3><p>At the first public meeting participants were asked to suggest project ideas under pre-prepared themes. These projects ideas were prioritised and the six most favourite were selected. Project ideas were costed and presented at a second public meeting for approval. A parallel prioritisation process was held with the primary school children who fed in their ideas for project proposals.<br/><br/>The projects put forward were: a controlled pedestrian crossing; refurbishing the war memorial, improved seating in a public open space; tree planting; transport for lunch club and improved sports facilities.</p><p>This is the first instance of a community council using some of it's precepts to fund a participatory budgeting project.</p><h3>Organisation:</h3>Together Creating Communities <h3>Aims:</h3><p><strong>To engage local residents in selecting priorities for Community Council money.</strong></p><ul><li>Engage residents in PB process with Community Council</li><li>Encourage new Community Councillors to come forward</li><li>To enable taxpayers to have a say in how money is spent</li><li>Develop citizenship in local school children</li><li>To trial the PB model in Wales</li><li>To engage policy makers in Wales</li><li>To develop a model of engagement in budgets for older people.</li></ul><h3>Where:</h3><p>Coedpoeth is a village in the county borough of Wrexham in north-east Wales.\u00a0 It has a population of 4,721 as measured by the 2001 census and is one of 34 communities (47 wards) in Wrexham County Borough.\u00a0 It's name translates into English as meaning burnt or wood, believe to derive from the production of charcoal for the smelting of iron and lead that was carried out in this area in Roman times.</p><p>But the 20th century saw a huge decline in traditional industries, and they and the railway which served them have all disappeared.\u00a0 Today Coedpoeth is largely a dormitory village supporting people who commute to work across a wide area including Manchester and Liverpool.</p><p>The village represents one political ward within Wrexham County Borough.\u00a0 The latest census figures suggest that, on the whole, people in the village are financially secure and there is little evidence of deprivation.\u00a0 But the figures for Lower Level Super Output Areas (smaller areas to identify pockets of difference) indicate significant variations across the village.</p><h3>How:</h3><ul><li>A Village Spend Steering Group was formed from local voluntary organisations to plan the process.</li><li>Priorities and project ideas identified at the first public meeting</li><li>Parallel process to identify project ideas in the local primary school.</li><li>Projects worked up and costed</li><li>Projects prioritised and selected for funding at second public meeting</li><li>Project ready for implementation by County Council</li></ul><p><br/>\u00a320,000 precept funds were made available.

The group already had good working relationships and had come together to explore how PB could be piloted in the Wrexham area.</p><p>After the Community Council agreed to the precept funds being used in a PB process, an initial meeting was held with what were described as the \u2018movers and shakers\u2019 in the village, such as chairs of community groups and other local leaders, with the aim of engaging them with the process so that they would communicate the idea and process to those they were in contact with.</p><p>A leaflet was then distributed to all residents in the village informing them about the process and inviting them to a public meeting. During the first public meeting participants were asked to suggest project ideas under pre-prepared themes which were then prioritised using sticky dots until six favourites were produced. A parallel prioritisation process was also held with primary schoolchildren who fed in their ideas for project proposals, although they did not attend the public meetings.</p><p>Project ideas were then costed and worked up and a second public meeting was held at which the projects were presented and participants asked to select their top 3. The result was a list of six prioritised projects.</p><p><strong>How the Village Spend, Coedpoeth process was initiated</strong><br/>By coincidence PB reached Coedpoeth by two routes. Having worked with TCC in a previous job, one member of the PB Unit saw an opportunity to introduce the idea into Wales alongside a like-minded organisation. An introductory workshop about PB was held at a participation conference in Wales, which gave the opportunity to bring together members of the north Wales voluntary sector who began to develop a vision for PB in the region. Seeking<br/>to test out interest locally, it was soon discovered that by chance the Chair of Coedpoeth Community Committee had<br/>recently attended a local government conference in which PB had been mentioned</p>", "title": "The Village Spend, Coedpoeth, North Wales "}

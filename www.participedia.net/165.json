{"htmlbody": "<p>The Oregon Health Decisions organization's method provides the opportunity for residents of Oregon from all ethnic, religious, and social backgrounds to get involved in the state's health care policy choices while being educated simultaneously on health care polices through citizen's assembly and community forums. From this method, Oregonians are able to depict their health care desires to the state government for consideration, allowing for the government to make legislative decisions based off of the wants and needs of the people of Oregon. The Oregon Health Decisions efforts correlate with helping low-income households select the most appropriate Medicaid plan that suit them.\n</p>", "title": "Oregon Health Decisions"}

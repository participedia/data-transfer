The work of the Town Meeting day was elaborated on in a report.</p><p>The February 6th 2010 Town Meeting took place in five places simultaneously which constituted important locations, from the point of view of the Tuscan landscape:</p><ul><li>Castelnuovo Berardenga;</li><li>Cortona;</li><li>Orbetello;</li><li>Piombino;</li><li>Prato.</li></ul><p>They debates centered around two principal themes:</p><ul><li>which are the most important characteristics of a landscape?\u00a0 that is, which should be protected or, when they disappear or are damaged, should be reconstructed?</li><li>what needs to happen to preserve (or rebuild) the Tuscan landscape's quality?</li></ul><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>The roughly 150 citizens involved were selected from the residents of the five geographically-related sites so that they could express their opinions on the places of their acquaintance.\u00a0 The participants were asked to contribute their creativity and listening capacity for the success of the event.\u00a0 The objective was not to build proposals from all participants but to investigate their perceptions of the landscape and the diverse opinions relating to the problem of conservation and transformation of the Tuscan landscape.</p><h3><strong>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></h3><p>In Tuscany, the chosen title for the February 6th, 2010 meeting was \u201cBeautiful is Possible.\u201d\u00a0 It was the seventh Town Meeting organized by the Region in four years.\u00a0 This time the work was not finished with table discussions, where the outcomes are decided through secret ballots, but continued through \u201cimagination labs\u201d where citizens and experts could join together around a large aerial photograph of the five respective territories to trace new lines for the landscape\u2019s future.</p><p>The Tuscans preferred recovering and reusing rather than damaging other land for new construction.\u00a0 At least, these were the thoughts of the majority of the 150 citizens who participated in the Town Meeting, the results of which were presented during the General State of the Landscape which took place in the auditorium of Santa Apollonia in Florence.\u00a0 Those same Tuscans wanted parks and green space, and cultural centers (but few habitations) in place of the vacant factories.\u00a0 They advised to rebuild the agricultural landscape, favoring small farms instead of monoculture and protecting the characteristic terraces.</p><p>The citizens also proposed constructing in a way that values the visual effect, avoiding noticeably unique buildings (\u201ccathedrals in the desert\u201d) and generally blending with the prevalent architecture, even perhaps shielding the industrial areas with barriers of trees, or choosing colors more appropriate to the landscape.\u00a0 They advised avoiding overly tall buildings on the coast, but for the promontory of Piombino they proposed architecture which would be visible from afar.\u00a0 They also requested bike paths.\u00a0 Almost one out of every three participants was ready to renounce overly frequent car use in order to protect the landscape, if there was adequate public transport available.\u00a0 For the Tuscans in the Town Meeting, the first thing on which they would intervene to restore the landscape were the private homes and degraded urban areas, followed by the old hill and mountain neighborhoods. When asked about institutional efforts to ensure the quality of construction, participants favored clear objectives to accompany private efforts (63%) rather than pre-set rigid guidelines (33%).\u00a0 All were favorable for the future of the \u201cgreen economy\u201d including hydraulic solar panels and geothermal, on the condition that one identified solutions which did not damage the environment or landscape (48%), though only after having informed and involved citizens (38%).\u00a0 They asked for participation mostly on the major decision and large projects, but believed that the responsibility for oversight and good construction needed to remain with the politicians and architects.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h3><p>The principal criticism regarding this case was certainly the lack of accountability to ensure that the government followed the decisions taken from citizens.\u00a0 In fact, the reported results were only general guidelines for the government.\u00a0 Therefore, underneath the appearance of effective citizen empowerment, the amount of power given to the citizens was ultimately weak.\u00a0 Thus, while the citizens, with the help of experts, could certainly give advice, the government was not at all obligated to accommodate their propositions.</p><h3><strong>External Links</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://www.regione.toscana.it/partecipazione\">http://www.regione.toscana.it/partecipazione</a>\u00a0[ITALIAN]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.regione.toscana.it/-/town-meeting-progettuale-sul-paesaggio-2010\">http://www.regione.toscana.it/-/town-meeting-progettuale-sul-paesaggio-2010</a>\u00a0[ITALIAN]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.regione.toscana.it/regione/export/RT/sito-RT/Contenuti/sezioni/territorio/paesaggio/visualizza_asset.html_558761280.html\">http://www.regione.toscana.it/regione/export/RT/sito-RT/Contenuti/sezioni/territorio/paesaggio/visualizza_asset.html_558761280.html</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.regione.toscana.it/regione/export/RT/sito-RT/Contenuti/sezioni/territorio/paesaggio/visualizza_asset.html_1661919580.html\">http://www.regione.toscana.it/regione/export/RT/sito-RT/Contenuti/sezioni/territorio/paesaggio/visualizza_asset.html_1661919580.html</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Notes</strong></h3><p><em>This is an English translation of the Italian case study found at <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/paesaggio-town-meeting-tuscany-italy\">http://participedia.net/cases/paesaggio-town-meeting-tuscany-italy</a></em></p>", "title": "Landscape Town Meeting (Tuscany, Italy)"}

A wide range of mechanisms can be employed for citizen co-creation:</p><p>\u2022 Online contests and competitions</p><p>\u2022 Mobile apps</p><p>\u2022 E-petitions</p><p>\u2022 Innovation jams</p><p>\u2022 Virtual design and prototyping tools</p><p>\u2022 Open-source databases</p><p>\u2022 Participatory design workshops</p><p>\u2022 Online citizen communities</p><p>To better understand the appropriateness of these diverse mechanisms for various citizen roles, the report examines two foundational elements of the support infrastructure needed for hosting citizen co-creation activities: the innovation ecosystem and the innovation platform.</p><p>\u2022 Innovation ecosystem relates to the organizing structure for citizens and government agencies to collaborate on problem-solving and includes ways to:</p><p>\u2013\u2013 Promote a shared worldview among all participants</p><p>\u2013\u2013 Define the architecture of participation to coordinate collaboration activities</p><p>\u2022 Innovation platform relates to the venue for citizen co-creation and incorporates ways to:</p><p>\u2013\u2013 Modularize or partition the problem-solving process</p><p>\u2013\u2013 Facilitate knowledge sharing and interactions among all the participants</p><p>In addition to presenting different citizen roles and their associated mechanisms, the report offers strategies and best practices for government agencies to:</p><p>\u2022 Enhance the shared worldview</p><p>\u2022 Specify the architecture of participation</p><p>\u2022 Modularize the problem-solving process</p><p>\u2022 Support interactions and knowledge sharing</p><p>Four strategies will assist government agencies in creating the broader innovation environment to promote citizen engagement and co-creation:</p><p>\u2022 Fit the co-creation approach to the problem-solving context.</p><p>\u2022 Manage citizen expectations with regard to their involvement.</p><p>\u2022 Link or connect the internal organization with the external partners.</p><p>\u2022 Embed the citizen engagement initiative in the larger context of the agency\u2019s core agenda.</p><p>There is considerable promise and potential to make a transformation in citizens\u2019 role in public services. The citizen co-creation framework and the recommendations offered here to establish appropriate mechanisms, structures, processes, tools and technologies, and incentive systems will advance this objective.</p><p>Please click <a href=\"http://www.businessofgovernment.org/report/engaging-citizens-co-creation-public-services\">here</a> to read the report.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "New Report: Engaging Citizens in Co-Creation in Public Services"}

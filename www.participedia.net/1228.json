{"htmlbody": "<p class=\"documentDescription\">The People's Fund was one of the original 5 pilots that the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funded to trial PB. They used a small community chest approach, with two events using PB to allocate \u00a315,000 and \u00a335,000 respectively. It was run by the local regeneneration programme known as Back on the Map, which was the public face of the Sunderland New Deal for Communities 10 year renewal initiative.</p><p class=\"documentDescription\">The project went on to run for many years in different guises and with different funding sources. In 2013 the Peoples Fund name continues, but is now a community panel and more consultative than direct voting in the community.

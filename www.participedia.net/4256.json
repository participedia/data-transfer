{"htmlbody": "<p>Preparing a write-up of this case will require knowledge of Portuguese &amp; significant primary research (PBcensus 3 - requires significant research). Although there are no existing case studies in English on Bento Gon\u00e7alves, the city was surveyed in the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census\">Participatory Budgeting Census 2012</a> (Spada et al. 2012). Thus, many of the fixed data fields provided by Participedia are complete. (The fixed data fields can be accessed and edited by logging onto this site and selecting the \u201cedit\u201d tab above the title of the case. Please see the \"help\" section on \"contributing content\" for additional guidance.)</p><p>The PB process in Bento Gon\u00e7alves was initiated in 2009 and it appears to be inactive in 2015. One website mentions that the process was changed in 2012 by having all meetings in just one place. Another website mentions the fact that the number of participants collapsed from 14000 to 2000 in 2013. Primary research is needed to complete the case. The included city website provides a telephone number to contact, but given that the process is not ongoing the former organizers might not work for the city anymore.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Note</p><p>We are uploading three type of cases using the information contained in the Participatory Budgeting Census 2012 that are tagged for easier retrieval in the following way:</p><p>PBcensus 1 - complete raw data</p><p>PBcensus 2 - requires phone call</p><p>PBcensus 3 - requires significant research</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>External Links</p><p><a href=\"http://www.spadap.com/data-collection-projects/the-brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census/\">http://www.spadap.com/data-collection-projects/the-brazilian-participato...</a> [Participatory Budgeting Census 2012]</p><p>\u00a0[city website provides contact information]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bentogoncalves.rs.gov.br/antiga/orcamento-participativo-tera-seis-assembleias-regionais-neste-ano\">http://www.bentogoncalves.rs.gov.br/antiga/orcamento-participativo-tera-...</a> [website that describes the change in the PB process that occurred in 2012]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.jornalsemanario.com.br/noticia/novo-animo-para-consulta-popular\">http://www.jornalsemanario.com.br/noticia/novo-animo-para-consulta-popular</a> [website that describes the drop in participants in 2013]</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Participatory Budgeting in Bento Gon\u00e7alves"}

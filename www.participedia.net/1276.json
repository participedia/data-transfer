{"htmlbody": "<p>If you live in central Luton you have a variety of opportunities to influence how their areas are improved in upcoming weeks thanks to participatory budgeting (PB) funding. \u200bPB funding can be applied for by community groups who use it to benefit the local area.<br/><br/>Once all applications are in, local community members come together at events called \u2018decision days\u2019 and vote on the projects they think will meet local priorities and improve the area the most. Projects with the most votes are then awarded funding.<br/><br/>Recently in Barnfield, Bushmead Residents Association secured funding to run a youth activity day to encourage healthy living.<br/><br/>The group, with the help of a number of young people, organised and held a free event for 72 young people in the area, offering a variety of activities and sports as well as information and guidance.<br/><br/>In addition to providing a good day out, the event gave the young people the opportunity to gain valuable planning and organisation skills.<br/><br/>Bushmead Junior Youth Club also benefitted, using funding to improve the programme of activities they offer to 7 -11 year olds, including for the first time some outdoor activities such as horse riding.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.luton.gov.uk/community_and_living/neighbourhood_and_village/Pages/default.aspx\">http://www.luton.gov.uk/community_and_living/neighbourhood_and_village/Pages/default.aspx</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Luton Participatory Budgeting"}

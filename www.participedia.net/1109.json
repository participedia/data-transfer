It was originally submitted by </em>Andreas Hoffelder<em>.</em></p><p>The \"L\u00fcbecker B\u00fcrgerkonferenz\" is planned by the \"Institut f\u00fcr Sozialmedizin der Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck\" under the administration of Professor Heiner Raspe. He wants to involve the citizens in the process of modernization of the German health care system. Following the example of Sweden, where a mix of ethics and cost-efficiency, called prioritisation, is handled in answering the question, which medical treatment is essential and which is not essential, the German citizens should get involved in this process.</p><h2>Project Description</h2><h3>Problem and Objective</h3><p>The medical progress causes a big gap between \"what is possible\" and \"what is \"affordable\". Not every medical achievement can be provided to every patient in the same way and an adequate dimension. Prioritisation identifies a certain order of priority. This can happen secret or in order to a public discussion. The L\u00fcbecker B\u00fcrgerkonferenz want to do prioritisation in public.</p><h3>Structure and Process</h3><p>23 random citizens of L\u00fcbeck met on three scheduling dates to engage in the theme of health care in Germany. Afterwards they got the chance to meet several experts. Together they worked out the details of the \"B\u00fcrgervotum\", containing the guidelines for prioritisation.</p><h3>Detailed Information</h3><h4>Target Group</h4><p>In the first step the citizens of L\u00fcbeck. But it should be an example for Germany in general.</p><h4>Total Number of People Addressed by the Project (approx.)</h4><p>82 millions</p><h4>Total Number of Active Participants (approx.)</h4><p>50</p>", "title": "L\u00fcbecker B\u00fcrgerkonferenz"}

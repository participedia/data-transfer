Bradford Vision secured a total of \u00a3130,000 to be spent on Children and Young People, Safer and Stronger Communities and the Environment to be spent only in areas\u00a0 of relative deprivation and therefore eligible for NRF funds. A reference group was formed comprising Bradford Vision staff, Keighley Voluntary Services, the council\u2019s area coordinator and a representative from the UK PB unit. Priorities were established through community events and door to door interviews. Voluntary organisations and local groups were then invited to submit bits which were then scrutinised by a panel made up of local councillors, members of the PB reference group, and staff from local statutory organisations.<br/><br/>All residents involved in the bidding process were then invited to a Decision Day where all the projects were presented and voted on.</p><h3>Organisation:</h3>Bradford Vision, Local Strategic Partnership <h3>Aims:</h3><ul><li>To involve local residents in the allocation of neighbourhood renewal funds (NRF) and the Local Area Agreement (LAA)funds.</li><li>To stimulate wider resident engagement with local participatory structures.</li><li>To develop greater resident understanding of budgeting processes</li><li>To increase cross-community working.</li><li>To encourage service provider receptiveness to resident knowledge.</li></ul><h3>Where:</h3><p>In 7 processes in 7 neighbourhoods in Keighley, Bradford District Council.</p><p>Keighley is a town within Bradford District Council and consists of x number of wards.\u00a0 Bradford is a very urban area with an ethnically diverse population and a known history of unrest between different ethnic groupings.\u00a0</p><h3>How:</h3><p>\u00a3130,000 was available for local projects from the Neighbourhood Renewal Funds.</p><p>Before the event a reference group was formed from staff at Bradford Vision, Keighley Voluntary Services, Bradford Council and the wider voluntary sector.

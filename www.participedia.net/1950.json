The Operational Unit of the OP will organize and streamline public meetings in all communities and urban neighborhoods of the Central Region. These meetings should have four main stages. First, accountability by the Municipal Executive on the implementation of the budget of the previous year and the budget estimates for the current year. Second, a debate among all present participants on the local needs. Third, voting on the investment priorities of the neighborhood or community in question. The final state is the election of two delegates per district or community. Out of these two, one should be a member of the local Residents Committee and the other a member of an association of community development. Where no local association exists, participants must elect (by secret ballot) the second delegate.</p><p>2) In the couple of months following the community meetings, there will be a technical evaluation of proposals voted on by communities and the development of a proposal for investments by the Executive. After all community meetings have taken place, the Operational Unit of the PB, or any other body designated by it, meets with the purpose of making technical analysis of all proposals that were voted.

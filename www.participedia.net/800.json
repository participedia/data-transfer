{"htmlbody": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>European Alternatives is a transnational membership organisation promoting democracy,\u00a0equality and culture beyond the nation state.\u00a0The nation state is no longer the appropriate political form in which to define democratic\u00a0decision-making and active citizenship, equality between people, the respect and\u00a0extension of rights. The nation state is not the appropriate political form to promote a\u00a0responsible politics for the environment, ensure political control over the economy and\u00a0an equitable distribution of wealth, or promote peace between people. European\u00a0Alternatives seeks to promote alternative forms of political subjectivity and collective\u00a0political action.<br/><br/>European Alternatives believes that social and political change requires artistic and\u00a0cultural engagement as much as other forms of engagement: social and political change\u00a0being understood by the organisation as a complete renewal of society which is not\u00a0limited to any one domain or sector.<br/><br/>European Alternatives does not believe that Europe can be defined in geographical or\u00a0ethnic terms, neither by borders nor roots. Europe must be understood as a space of\u00a0exchange, of experimentation and of dialogue.</p><p>You can find more information on our mission here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.euroalter.com/mission/\">http://www.euroalter.com/mission/</a></p><h3>History</h3><p>The organisation was officially born in 2007 in London \u00a0and started with the organisation of the London Festival of Europe,\u00a0bringing to London a series of free public events and artistic happenings promoting imaginative thinking about Europe\u2019s future and its relation to the rest of the world, to mark the 50th anniversary of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Rome\" title=\"Treaties of Rome\">Treaties of Rome</a>.

The Municipality approved a new District Regulation which delegates greater powers to districts and allows for new forms of participation designed to involve citizens and associations in decision-making.\u00a0</p><p>Participatory budgeting is one of the principal participatory methods used by the Reggio Municipality.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The process cost 13.500 Euros (7.500 Euros for staff and 6.000 Euros for information material).\u00a0 Sponsors paid for 5.000 Euros while the administration paid the remaining 8.500.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The Office of Decentralization, Participation, and Deliberative Processes (Municipal Office of \u201cParticipation and Accountability\u201d)\u00a0coordinated and facilitated public meetings in which the residents could voice their concerns. Posters and flyers were printed and distributed for their promotions.</p><p>In total, 256 people (188 male, 68 female) took participated. Most participants were between 36 and 60 years of age.</p><p>In each meeting, participants elected 2 delegates from among themselves. These took part in the more detailed, technical aspects of enacting the discussions' agreements with municipal experts in the material and the project\u2019s steering committee, on behalf of the Department of Decentralization, Participation, and Deliberative Processes (Reggio\u2019s Sustainability Office).</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The participatory process began in September 2007 and concluded in February 2008.\u00a0 It was divided into three phases:</p><ol><li>collection of proposals and needs</li><li>evaluation of the proposals</li><li>presentation of the results</li></ol><p>Between September 25th and October 7th, there were 5 public meetings, one with each neighborhood (the first phase).\u00a0 To carry this out, District 8 of Reggio was divided into 5 areas defined as \u201cneighborhoods\u201d:\u00a0 Villa Sesso, Gardenia-Tondo, Roncocesi, Cavazzoli, and San Prospero Strinati. \u00a0A meeting was held in each of these neighborhoods with the intent of discovering the needs and collecting the residents' proposals.\u00a0 Each participant could take up to 3 minutes to make his/her intervention, and could make up to 2 proposals and present up to 2 needs.\u00a0 The proposals would fall under four pre-established areas:\u00a0 public operations, environment, sport/culture/youth policies, and social policies. The requests and proposals were then classified according to the magnitude of required intervention (simple reports, neighborhood-scale interventions, or city-scale interventions).</p><p>In November, municipal officials began to evaluate the citizens' proposals (the second phase). Afterwards, the District Council and the City Council decided which proposals were \u201cfeasible\u201d for inclusion in the 2008 Budget.\u00a0 On April 2, 2008, the results were presented in a public assembly (the third and final phase of the project), which around 100 people attended.</p><p>The citizens were punctually informed of the results as the process developed through its various phases.\u00a0 Communication was achieved through a newspaper published in tabloid format and distributed to all houses in the related regions.\u00a0 This paper had three functions:</p><ol><li>communication of the advance of the project</li><li>communication of the proposals emerged from the neighborhood assemblies</li><li>communication of the evaluation of the proposals</li></ol><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>123 proposals emerged from the process, of which 17 were included in the 2008 budget.\u00a0 In general, the proposals aimed to improve the region\u2019s livability, such as proposals to create greater space and security for pedestrians, or to improve public lighting.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>After the April 2nd assembly in which citizens learned of the decisions adopted by the administration with regard to their proposals, they had the opportunity to ask for clarification and to express their opinions with respect to the Participatory Budgeting experiment.</p><p>The participants in general were satisfied with the process, mainly because it was the launch of a participatory process, it kept the citizenry informed, and those who participated felt involved.\u00a0 The involved participants judged the experiment positively.\u00a0 In fact, their opinion was more positive than it had been before the experience, which gives hope for greater citizen involvement in the future.</p><p>However, those who took part in the process argued that participation could be improved through a larger listening phase and the adoption of more proposals.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\"Un Bilancio Con Le Tue Idee/A Budget With Your Ideas (Italiano)\". \u00a0Participedia.net. \u00a0Retrieved 9 March 2012 from <a href=\"http://www.participedia.net/cases/un-bilancio-con-le-tue-ideea-budget-your-ideas-italiano\">http://www.participedia.net/cases/un-bilancio-con-le-tue-ideea-budget-yo...</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "A Budget With Your Ideas (Reggio Emilia, Italy)"}

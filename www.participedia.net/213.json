{"htmlbody": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>MASS LBP's work goes far beyond polling or focus groups. From conception to execution to evaluation, MASS LBP designs and delivers highly innovative engagement strategies that increase public understanding, legitimacy and support for complex decisions and policy choices.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Inspired by Canada's first Citizens' Assemblies, MASS LBP was founded in 2007 by Peter MacLeod and George Gosbee to extend this model and reinvent public consultation. MASS LBP is based in Toronto with staff in Vancouver, Ottawa and London, UK.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Our services include:</p><ul><li>Comprehensive process design and delivery \u2013 from 20 to 200+ participants</li><li>Strategic advice concerning effective engagement</li><li>Corporate and public needs assessment</li><li>Program evaluation and analysis</li><li>Custom research and dissemination</li><li>Facilitation teams</li><li>Public communications and curriculum development</li><li>Event coordination and logistics</li></ul><p>MASS LBP's principal methods are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/civic-lottery\">Civic\u00a0Lottery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-reference-panel\">Citizens' Reference Panel</a></li></ul><p>There are only two salary levels at MASS. Currently, all staff with one year of service earn $47,500 per year. First year staff earn $42,500. Part-time staff earn either of the two rates on a pro-rata basis. Why disclose our salaries? Because it seems like the right thing to do. MASS is fortunate to work on projects often funded with public monies and we want our clients and citizen-participants to know where we stand \u2013 and we think that includes knowing what we earn.</p><p>In 2010, we will also be introducing proactive disclosure with all of our public sector clients. This means that all of our contracts and fees will be posted to this website. It's a small thing but again, we just feel its the right thing to do. We wish more consultants would do the same.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><p>MASS LBP's major projects include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-reference-panel-health-technologies-ontario-canada\">Citizens' Reference Panel on Health Technologies - Ontario Canada</a> (2009-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/mississauga-halton-citizens-reference-panel-integrated-health-services-plan\">Mississauga-Halton Citizens' Reference Panel Integrated Health Services Plan</a> (2009)</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/northumberland-hills-hospital-s-collaborative-budget-strategy-cobourg-ontario-canada\">Northumberland Hills Hospital\u2019s Collaborative Budget Strategy (Cobourg, Ontario, Canada)</a> (2009)</li><li><a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/south-east-ontario-citizens-reference-panel-integrated-health-services-plan\">South East Ontario Citizens' Reference Panel Integrated Health Services Plan</a> (2009?)</li></ul><h3>Publications</h3><p><em>Mass LBP</em> <em>Journal</em>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.masslbp.com/journal.php\">http://www.masslbp.com/journal.php</a></p><p>Mass LBP Publications,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.masslbp.com/publications.php\">http://www.masslbp.com/publications.php</a></p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Mississauga Halton Local Health Integration Network.

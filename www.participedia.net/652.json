{"htmlbody": "<h3>Problems, Purpose, History\u00a0</h3><p>Originating in Puerto Alegre in 1989, Participatory Budgeting (PB) has been implemented throughout the world. \u00a0Jarabacoa is not a place known for its strength of civil society or citizen engagement. \u00a0This pilot program of PB using SMS aims to increase civil society and involve citizens for greater government transparency and accountability. PB is part of a broader better governance intitative of the World Bank Initative and United Nations Development Program. \u00a0PB has been regarded as a \"best practice\" for open and more effective governance. \u00a0The pilot project is part of a larger World Bank Institute programmatic strategy of using Internet Communication Technologies (ICT) for greater citizen engagement and participation. \u00a0The pilot uses SMS as a two way communicative tool for citizens to be involved with budgetary decision making.\u00a0</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>Program sponsored by the World Bank Institute's ICT4Gov divison working with local partners on the ground.Jarabacoa Municipal\u00a0Council approved the plan to integrate SMS into PB and conveyed information regarding dates, times, and locations for meetings.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>A total of 848 cell phone numbers were collected through disparate measures: by the delegates of PB, through community leaders and community meetings, and by going house to house to collect information. The initial SMS contact invited participants to an in person community assembly for PB on Friday January 13th and voting for Saturday January 14.th In addition to meeting date and location information these messages were personalized with the recipients name and a message tailored uniquely for women with motivational phrases such as \u201cWomen, let out voices be heard!\u201d In contrast, the message inviting men to vote simply said, \u201cHave you voted for your favorite work?\u201d</p><p>SMS was the most successful media to convince people to participate. 32.2% of people in the district targeted by SMS had not participated before in PB, while in district that were not targeted by SMS only 20.9% new participants showed up. Community leaders were less convincing than SMS to encourage people to participate.\u00a0SMS was also effective at bringing out people who had not participated in PB before.\u00a0 People living in districts targeted by the SMS campaign are more likely to declare that they are members of a party or a political association. \u00a061% of people are members in an SMS district, while only 55% are members in a non-SMS district.\u00a0 SMS reached out more to people that did not participated in PB before but were participants in traditional politics.\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>A second type of SMS contact enabled recipients to text back with a vote choice.\u00a0 The Jarabacoa Municipal Council, governing the rules of PB, decided that vote results collected through SMS would be given the weight of 25% of the elected work in participatory budget assemblies.\u00a0 When voting via SMS recipients were given two project options and a third \u201cother work\u201d option that indicated that neither of the first options matched the voter\u2019s preferences.\u00a0 The works elected through SMS ended up as the winning entry at one of the in person budget assemblies.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>SMS messages instructing people to vote were effective motivators for voting participation.\u00a0 78% of survey participants identified SMS as a very useful mechanism to be informed of PB meetings.\u00a0 SMS was identified as the way the majority of the new and returning participants heard about PB. 62% of new participants and 54% of returning participants found out about PB through SMS and 55% of them said SMS was the reason for them to attend more meetings.\u00a0 59% of the people who attended a meeting received an SMS to vote for a PB work with 81% of respondents feeling favorably about SMS as a complementary voting tool for PB.</p><p>The data shows citizens enjoyed receiving SMS messages without a backlash.\u00a0 The district targeted by SMS viewed SMS as the most useful tool to convey information.\u00a0 Therefore, citizens were not frustrated or annoyed by receiving SMS as a complement to voting\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Critics could contend that one of the principal goals of PB is to bring people for face-to-face deliberation and communicative. \u00a0Based on Habermas' ideal of communicative action (1989), some may question the ability for SMS-enhanced PB to create lasting civic relationships and social capital (Putnam 1993). \u00a0The impact of ICT platforms of civic engagement is a nascent field without enough research behind it to make solid claims for its usefulness. \u00a0In order for SMS enhanced PB to worth doing, it must show that SMS can be effective two way tool while also building the important in-person relationships that PB is so effective as forging.\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://beta.ict4gov.org/countries/dominican-republic/\">Open Development Technology Alliance - Dominican Republic</a></p><p><a href=\"http://thegovlab.org/wiki/World_Bank_ICT4Gov\">GovLab - World Bank ICT4Gov</a></p><p><a href=\"http://wbi.worldbank.org/boost/Data/boost/boostcms/files/field/tools-resources-attachment/presentation_icts.pdf\">World Bank ICT4Gov Presentation</a></p>", "title": "Participatory Budgeting with SMS (Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic) "}

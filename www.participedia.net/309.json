{"htmlbody": "<a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a><h2> Mission and Purpose </h2>\n<p>GOV2U <a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.gov2u.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.gov2u.org\">[1]</a> is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that supports political discourse between citizens and elected officials through the use of technology. The organization helps provides opportunities for citizens to actively engage themselves in deliberation with officials to best practice democracy and to improve policy-making procedures. \n</p><p>Its main focus is to further develop Information Communication Technologies (ICT) tools, which will help promote transparent governance by giving citizens more opportunities to participate. \n</p>\n<p>Gov2U\u2019s main goal is to have a Global Leadership Profile so that it can globally share its innovative tools of bettering governments. Their goal can be achieved by completing these five objectives:\t\n</p><p>(1) The organization hopes to promote the use of ICT-tools between Legislative and Elected Bodies to make such parliamentary and legislative procedures more efficient. By doing so, they will be creating this sense of transparency between the citizen\u2019s opinions and the Elected Bodies\u2019 decisions. Thus, it helps the people have a stronger voice in their government. \n</p><p>(2) By becoming one of the leading organizations, GOV2U feels that it has the necessary tools to make Legislatures more effective and make the democratic process stronger. Democracy is the idea of giving the people the opportunity to voice their opinions to the officials whom they have elected. By using modern technology, as GOV2U suggest and since most are accustomed to the online network, society would be more inclined to participate since it is made readily available to them. At GOV2U, they believe in the unrealized potential of ICT-tools and how its significant value can help increase democratic participation. \n</p><p>(3) It hopes to educate both citizens and Elected bodies in regards to public information and political issues through ICT-tools because they feel it will increase the accountability between both sides since the data will be readily accessible. \n</p><p>(4) By using unique and innovative ICT-tools, this organization wishes that this would help instill a sense of motivation to other organizations and governments to advance their current tools. By doing so, new standards will be expected for their projects and thus, will result in new developments to better the organization and its practices in the future years to come. \n</p><p>(5) Lastly, GOV2U is able to ultimately have the Global Leadership Profile they wish to attain through sharing their knowledge and creativity \u201cto the community of public, academic, civil, and private professionals and citizens through workshops, seminars, and conferences.\u201d This not only helps their public relations images but also establishes them as a credible, strong, and branded source that others would trust because its great presence.\n</p>\n<a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a><h2> History </h2>\n<p>In 2005, a group of professionals from the fields of Legislative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and community activism, including its current Executive Director, Vasilis Koulolias, created a non-profit, non-governmental organization now known as GOV2U to better citizens\u2019 participation in the decision making processes of their governments.

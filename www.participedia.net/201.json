Could greater participation of the public in political processes lead to better, fairer, more sustainable decisions, and, if so, how could this best be achieved?</p><p>During 2008, the Partnership for Public Participation was formed to research experiences and results of public participation throughout the world, but particularly in three European countries of interest to the partners: Germany, Italy and United Kingdom. This led directly to the report <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\">Public Participation in Europe</a>, which highlighted three key factors that need to be addressed for public participation to be effective:</p><ul><li>A clearly defined constitutional framework for public participation. Only through an explicit, shared understanding between politicians and citizens can confidence be developed and public participation realize its democratizing potential.</li><li>A systematic approach to public participation methods to help organizers of public participation processes choose the most suitable and effective methods.</li><li>Rigorous and challenging evaluation of public participation in practice to develop a culture of learning about participation and advance the systematization of participation methods.</li></ul><p>EIPP was launched on 1 January 2009 specifically to address these issues. <a id=\"Activities\" name=\"Activities\"></a></p><h2>Activities</h2><p>EIPP is involved in three main activities. <a id=\"Research\" name=\"Research\"></a></p><h3>Research</h3><p>Undertaking research into public participation activities, mainly, but not exclusively, in Europe.

EIPP has recently completed a major evaluation of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.buergerforum2009.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.buergerforum2009.de/\">B\u00fcrgerForum Europa</a>, a large-scale participatory process over eight months, which developed understanding of how German citizens view the future of Europe and involved politicians at the highest level (including German Chancellor, Angela Merkel).</p><p>EIPP is currently developing the European Evaluation Framework for Public Participation with partners across Europe and looking to test this with a range of live participation activities, including <a href=\"/methods/participatory-budgeting\" title=\"Participatory Budgeting\"> Participatory Budgeting</a> in the UK. <a id=\"Dissemination_of_What_Works.2C_When\" name=\"Dissemination_of_What_Works.2C_When\"></a></p><h3>Dissemination of What Works, When</h3><p>EIPP seeks to disseminate the findings of its research and evidence-based evaluation through any appropriate channels such as</p><ul><li>reports, eg <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\">Public Participation in Europe</a></li><li>newspaper articles, eg <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/24/europawahl-buergerbeteiligung\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.zeit.de/online/2009/24/europawahl-buergerbeteiligung\">Rezepte gegen die Europam\u00fcdigkeit</a></li><li>broadcast interviews, eg <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.funkhaus-europa.de/sendungen/radio_colonia/italgermania/2009/090809_europa.phtml\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.funkhaus-europa.de/sendungen/radio_colonia/italgermania/2009/090809_europa.phtml\">Quest'Europa s'ha da fare </a></li><li>conferences and seminars, eg <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/agenda-esrc-seminar-3.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/agenda-esrc-seminar-3.doc\">Measuring the Impact of Involvement, NHS Centre for Involvement</a></li></ul><p><a id=\"Funding\" name=\"Funding\"></a></p><h2>Funding</h2><p>EIPP is a not-for-profit organisation which receives core funding from its founder members and project funding from clients to undertake research, evaluation and dissemination activities. <a id=\"Key_Publications\" name=\"Key_Publications\"></a></p><h2>Key Publications</h2><ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pp_in_e_report_03_06.pdf\">Public Participation in Europe</a></li><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/making_their_voice_heardfinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://participationinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/making_their_voice_heardfinal.pdf\">Making their Voices Heard and Listened To</a></li></ul><p><a id=\"Links\" name=\"Links\"></a></p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participationinstitute.org/\">European Institute for Public Participation site</a></li></ul>", "title": "European Institute for Public Participation"}

It was originally submitted by </em>Andreas Hoffelder<em>.</em></p><p>The project involves scoping, service mapping and community engagement in 3 locations to identify barriers to the integrated delivery of assistance to help jobless families at the local level. It is designed to assist jobless families to move into education and employment. The demonstration project will be implemented in three specific sites - Broadmeadows (Vic), Goodna (Qld) and Mansfield Park (SA). The objective of the project is to test integrated family-centred service delivery models for participating families.</p><h2>Project Description</h2><h3>Structure and Process</h3><p>A key aspect of the project is that the approach focuses on the needs of the family unit (not an individualised approach as is used by employment services providers and in relation to income support participation requirements) to explore barriers to inclusion and paid employment, such as educational attainment; housing stability; health or disability related problems, childcare, transport and motivation. The community engagement phase includes consultations with families, community stakeholders, local and state government, NGOs, employers and local service providers (e.g. Language, Literacy and Numeracy (LLNP) services, family support, mental health, migrant resource, transport and childcare providers). This gives a range of perspectives on barriers to inclusion of disadvantaged groups.</p><h2>Links</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.sprc.unsw.edu.au/projects/family-centred-employment-project-78.html\">Family-centred employment project</a></p>", "title": "Family-Centred Employment Project"}

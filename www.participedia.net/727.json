{"htmlbody": "<h3>Definition</h3>Citizen Conferences allow for citizens to deliberate and provide policy\u00a0recommendations for a\u00a0government entity.\u00a0 The government entity\u00a0can then use\u00a0these recommendations to better meet the needs of its citizens.<h3 class=\"field-item even\"><strong>Participants</strong></h3><p>The participants in citizen conferences are selected randomly to represent the diverse sets of opinions and demographics of a region (e.g. a State). \u00a0These participants are usually ordinary citizens, not stakeholders or professional lobbyists. \u00a0They voluntarily participate, are given a $200 honorarium post the completion of the event, and are called \"citizen advisors.\"</p><p>There is a panel of experts present who have been selected by the government entity to represent a broad range of expertise on the specific\u00a0sector being discussed. \u00a0And, there is a government selected moderator who aids in the deliberation portion of the event.</p><p>Finally, concerned citizens may attend to observe and make brief statements during the question-and-answer session.</p><h3>Process</h3><p>A citizen conference is a one-day event and typically lasts from 8am to 5pm. \u00a0Prior to attending, the citizen advisors are given a brochure to read that explains the purpose of the event and illustrates a set of government proposed policies\u00a0or the\u00a0sector (e.g. transportation)\u00a0being discussed.\u00a0 If the government lists proposed policies, it is because they need fine tuning\u00a0and the government entity would like to know which are most important to\u00a0its citizens.\u00a0 If there are no proposed policies listed, the citizen conference allows for the advisors to come up with their own\u00a0policies for a specific\u00a0sector.</p><p>The event begins with breakfast and a question-and-answer session. \u00a0During the session, the citizen advisors are able to ask the expert panelists and concerned citizens' about the proposed policies or sector. \u00a0After the session, the concerned citizens are allowed to make brief comments to the advisors and panelists. \u00a0When there are no more comments, the citizen advisors take a lunch break.</p><p>After the lunch break, the citizen advisors head to a deliberation room (which is live streamed via a television for the panelists to observe) and start discussing their opinions on the sector, the proposed policies, and the newly absorbed information.\u00a0 During this deliberation, the moderator encourages the advisors to come up with consensual policy recommendations that meet the needs of all the citizens they represent. \u00a0If necessary, the advisors may consult with the panel of experts to ask any final questions they might have.</p><p>Once the recommendations have been decided on, with the help of the moderator the advisors draft them and prepare to present them to the public and media. \u00a0All the advisors then go to a location where a press conference can be held, and one of the advisors reads aloud the recommendations. \u00a0After the recommendations have been announced to the public and media, the public and media are given time to ask the advisors questions about their opinions, policy choices, and experiences.</p><h3>Influence and Power</h3><p>Citizen conferences\u00a0may or may not be linked to any type of election.\u00a0 If they are not, it may be\u00a0difficult to directly influence public officials. \u00a0But, it should be noted that in many cases a citizen conference is the only basis for which a government entity can clearly hear its citizens' voices. \u00a0Thus, the recommendations set forth by the advisors\u00a0should\u00a0persuade\u00a0public officials.\u00a0 If they are linked to an election, a direct influence\u00a0is\u00a0more expected.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/20072008-new-mexico-citizen-conferences-0\">2007/2008 New Mexico Citizen Conferences</a></p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1.

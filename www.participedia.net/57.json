Since 2002, cities with more than 80,000 residents have been mandated by law (Loi #2002-276 relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratie de proximit\u00e9) to establish neighborhood councils. Many cities and towns with fewer than 80,000 residents also have their own neighborhood councils. Local elected councils are fully responsible for the form, remit, and membership that neighborhood councils take. Neighborhood councils have no formal decision-making powers but rather exist as consultative bodies that elected politicians - in principle - turn to in order to engage with and ascertain the views of local populations on specific questions. In some towns and cities, elected councils provide their neighborhood councils with a small discretionary budget of their own (referred to as an \u201cenveloppe budg\u00e9taire\u201d). <a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Blondiaux, Lo\u00efc. 2000. \u201cLa d\u00e9mocratie par le bas.

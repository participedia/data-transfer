{"htmlbody": "<p>Demarchy (or lottocracy) is a form of government in which the state is governed by randomly selected decision makers who have been selected by sortition (lot) from a broadly inclusive pool of eligible citizens. These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"[<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Citizens%27_Jury\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Citizens%27_Jury\">[1]</a>]citizens' juries\", or \"[<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Consensus_Conference\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Consensus_Conference\">[2]</a>]consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that juries decide criminal cases.</p><p>Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional representative democracy, which is widely subject to manipulation by special interests and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher John Burnheim, random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.</p><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy\">Demarchy</a></p>", "title": "Demarchy"}

{"htmlbody": "<h3>Summary</h3><p>This case study features the ten\u00a02007/2008\u00a0<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/citizen-conferences\">Citizen Conferences</a>, each consisting\u00a0of 8 to 10 New Mexican Adult Citizens and lasting 9 hours.\u00a0 This series of\u00a0deliberative\u00a0events was\u00a0convened by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT)\u00a0and the University of New Mexico's\u00a0Institute\u00a0for Public Policy (IPP)\u00a0to gather public feedback, so that the\u00a0State could best meet the transportation needs of its citizens.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The needs and concerns of its citizens and local governments\u00a0are very important to the State of New Mexico.\u00a0 With over 90% of\u00a0its citizens driving a car or truck every day, transportation\u00a0is a crucial sector for New Mexico. (1) \u00a0Unfortunately, because of the economic recession, the transportation budget funded by the National Government to the NMDOT has been declining annually.\u00a0 Despite the declining\u00a0transportation budget, the NMDOT remains faithful to the needs of its citizens and local governments.</p><p>In order to meet the needs of its citizens, the\u00a0NMDOT with help from the\u00a0IPP\u00a0decided to\u00a0host a\u00a0series of\u00a0citizen conferences to allocate larger portions of its budget to more appropriate areas.\u00a0 These conferences intended to allow New Mexican\u00a0Citizens to create a list of\u00a0policy recommendations\u00a0for the NMDOT to consider when creating its New Mexico\u00a02030 Multimodal\u00a0Transportation\u00a0Plan\u00a0(future goals and objectives).</p><h3>History</h3><p>Citizen conferences are\u00a0not new\u00a0to the State of New Mexico.\u00a0 For example, in 1996, \"to learn the public\u2019s views on long-range transportation planning, the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department (NMSHTD) contracted with the University of New Mexico Institute for Public Policy (IPP) to hold a series of six public meetings called 'Citizen Conferences.' The conferences were designed to learn what transportation policy the general public would recommend if it had the time and resources necessary to arrive at informed opinions on the issue.\"\u00a0 Just like in\u00a0the 2007/2008 Conferences, the participants in 1996 Conferences were randomly selected to \"represent the diverse views and experiences of the New Mexico Public.\"\u00a0 The\u00a0overall consensus\u00a0was that, \"New Mexico should focus its energy on maintaining the existing network of state highways. As the Gallup citizen advisors said in their recommendations, 'We believe that the State of New Mexico should maintain as many of the state roads as possible through resurfacing and repairs. Many state roads need improvements, but first we have to maintain the road system we have. Even the least traveled state roads are still serving a purpose and are important to people living in rural parts of the state.' The citizen advisors in Albuquerque, Roswell, and Las Cruces shared this view.\" (2)</p><p>John Gastil (Head and Professor of Communication Arts and Sciences at Penn State University and Convener of the 1996 New Mexico Citizen Conferences) stated the following about the conferences: \"The New Mexico Highway and Transportation Department needed to understand the public\u2019s policy preferences so that it could set the flexible portion of its budget for the coming years, and it faced a difficult tradeoff between improving the most heavily traveled freeways or maintaining the much larger network of rural highways. The Department had previously conducted telephone surveys, but these did not give a clear sense of the public\u2019s preferences, and the Department was not confident that the surveys yielded an informed set of preferences. The six Citizen Conferences, held in each region of the state, provided a clearer picture of the public\u2019s preferences. Each conference lasted only one day, but after hearing testimony and deliberating together, each group of citizens reached a clear set of recommendations. Taken as a whole, these favored improving the core road system, and the Department was able to move forward.\"\u00a0 But, \"when public forums are not directly connected to the policymaking process, there is no guarantee that they will result in better public decisions, even when they offer clear and useful guidance to policymakers,\" thus, these conferences did not guarantee the citizens had much influence on policy. (3)</p><p>Contrary to the 1996 recommendations' lack of influence (2),\u00a0the 2007/2008 New Mexico Citizen Conferences' recommendations were \"incorporated into the Goals and Objectives of\u00a0the 2030 Plan in the locations noted, with slight modifications\u00a0if needed to address the\u00a0Department\u2019s ability to actualize them, considering cost/benefits, available funding and\u00a0staffing levels.\"\u00a0(1)</p><h3>Funding and Budgeting\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</h3><p>The United States\u00a0Congress authorizes budgets and allocates funds to its\u00a0States for transportation.\u00a0 As mentioned above, unfortunately, Congress has been significantly\u00a0cutting the budget annually.\u00a0 In 2009, the NMDOT was allocated $12 billion for\u00a0the\u00a0span of the next\u00a029 years by the U.S. Government, subject to change. (1)</p><p>The NMDOT\u00a0creates its budget from reviewing regulatory influences: federal and state determined guidelines and\u00a0political influences: politicians, interest groups, and citizens.\u00a0 Because there\u00a0are a large and diverse number of\u00a0constituents, it is often difficult to hear and incorporate citizens' concerns into a budget.\u00a0 Thus, the\u00a02007/2008\u00a0Citizen Conferences\u00a0were a great opportunity to fix this common budgeting\u00a0problem.</p><p><em>Note: This section is in need of\u00a0content and more detail.\u00a0 Specifically, how much New Mexico's transportation budget\u00a0has been declining over the past several years.</em></p><h3>Participation Selection</h3><p>Each of the ten Citizen Conferences\u00a0were made up of 8 to10 adult citizens and\u00a0represented the\u00a0different areas and\u00a0diverse demographics of New Mexico.\u00a0 The randomly selected citizens\u00a0were known as Citizen Advisors and received an honorarium for their time.</p><p>The panel of experts\u00a0was chosen by the NMDOT and IPP to represent a range of diverse expertise\u00a0on\u00a0the sector of transportation.</p><p>The moderator\u00a0was a deliberative expert selected by the IPP to ensure all views and arguments\u00a0were mentioned in the deliberation room and that the Citizen Advisors stayed on track.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The conferences\u00a0were set up for one day. \u00a0First, (by reading a brochure)\u00a0the Citizen Advisors\u00a0were informed about the\u00a0purpose of the deliberative event: the NMDOT and IPP wanted to\u00a0hear the transportation needs and concerns of its citizens\u00a0so that they could\u00a0implement them into their future budgeting plan.</p><p>The citizen conferences\u00a0began with a breakfast and introductions.\u00a0\u00a0After the introductions, a\u00a0question-and-answer session commenced. \u00a0During the session, the Citizen Advisors asked the Expert Panelists and other\u00a0citizens present about current\u00a0New Mexico transportation situation\u00a0and any other questions they might have had.\u00a0\u00a0After the session everyone took an hour break for lunch.</p><p>Post lunch, the Citizen Advisors went into a deliberation room with the moderator and had three hours to compile a list of recommendations to present to the public and media.\u00a0 During the deliberation, the moderator encouraged the Citizen Advisor to consider all of the ideas proposed but\u00a0really focus on those benefiting the larger public.</p><p>Once the deliberation was over, the moderator worked with the Citizen Advisors to prepare a formal draft of recommendations to announce.\u00a0 Once written, the Citizen Advisors\u00a0announced the recommendations to the Panel of Experts, the other citizens present, and the media.\u00a0 After the recommendations were made public, there was thirty minutes set aside for interviews and informal discussion.

Alternative Modes:</p><ul><li>Promote the use of public transportation, including expanding services and providing incentives for use (this recommendation, or something very similar, was common to all 10 citizen conferences). These recommendations included both fixed route and on-demand services; regional and local services; work, service, and emergency-based trips; and multiple-sized programs that ranged from single van to regional park-and-ride services</li><li>Improve advertising about public transportation options</li><li>Build or improve sidewalks in District 4</li><li>Developing and improving bike routes in rural and urban areas</li><li>Widen shoulders along NM 6563 for bicycles</li><li>Support, expand, and/or improve regional aviation in the growing, urban areas</li><li>Reconsider the context of the rail freight system, Farmington to Gallup, Farmington to Albuquerque</li><li>Build and elevated loop rail system connecting all four quadrants of the Albuquerque area</li><li>Extend Rail Runner to Deming</li></ul><p>D. Process and Funding:</p><ul><li>Increase NMDOT revenues for meeting New Mexico\u2019s transportation needs (this recommendation was expressed at all 10 Citizen Conferences, although many times it did not rank as a high priority because of instructions to the Citizen Advisors not to consider funding)</li><li>Improve the funding formulas for transportation programs to better meet regional needs</li><li>Develop a data-driven, scientifically-based decision-making method for prioritizing projects and programs</li><li>Improve the public-input process between local officials, transportation planners and the public</li><li>Create and staff a hotline or website to report transportation concerns (1)</li></ul><p>All of the recommendations decided by the Citizen Advisors were announced to the media and any concerned or interested citizens present\u00a0at the end of the event.\u00a0 The recommendations (listed above) are outlined\u00a0in the New Mexico 2030 Multimodal Transportation Plan, which is available to the public for download\u00a0via the internet.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The recommendations noted above (also, listed in the New Mexico 2030 Multimodal Transportation Plan) are\u00a0a summary of the Citizen Advisors' announced\u00a0recommendations. \u00a0Therefore, the Citizen Conferences were able to have a huge\u00a0influence on the future goals and budget of the NMDOT.\u00a0 It is important to understand that the Citizen Advisors had\u00a0a\u00a0considerable amount of\u00a0power in this\u00a0case.\u00a0 Their\u00a0proposed recommendations were put into a plan that\u00a0outlines the\u00a0NMDOT's future decisions and policies.\u00a0 The goals and objectives of the\u00a0New Mexico 2030\u00a0Multimodal Transportation Plan\u00a0\"add up to a subtle shift in direction for the NMDOT, one that builds upon prior initiatives, plans and policies while giving even greater emphasis to multi-modalism (including nontraditional, non-motorized modes of travel) and Travel Demand Management (TDM), environmental and cultural resource conservation, and partnering with other agencies and local entities to promote sustainable economic development and jobs creation, and to facilitate livability in terms of residents enjoying a broad range of transportation choices.\" (1)</p><p><em>Note: This section is in need of\u00a0outcomes and effects.\u00a0 It would be interesting to find out which of these recommendations have been implemented and their\u00a0positive or negative effects\u00a0on\u00a0citizens.\u00a0\u00a0Try contacting: Heather Sandoval (Engineer and NMDOT\u00a0Official) --\u00a0 <a href=\"tel:(800) 234-7520\">(800) 234-7520</a>\u00a0 (NMDOT Sector 6 Office).</em></p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>When the Conferences first emerged in New Mexico (1996), John Gastil asked, \"What was the ultimate impact of these conferences on policy and public officials?\" \u00a0James Kozak (Transportation Department official who oversaw the\u00a0conferences) answered by stating, \"their main impact on public officials was to restore faith in the competence and wisdom of the general public. The citizens arrived at policy recommendations that, from the department's perspective, were realistic and clear expressions of the public's basic concerns about highway transportation. Because the conferences were not linked to elections in any way, however, they had no appreciable influence on public officials beyond their\u00a0persuasiveness as the only clear recording of a representative, deliberative public voice on transportation policy.\" (4)\u00a0 Thus, although they intended to directly influence public officials, there was no guarantee they would.</p><p>However,\u00a0it is now\u00a0clear that since the 1996\u00a0emergence of the Conferences in New Mexico, public officials have made huge strides to actually give Citizen Advisors more influence/power.\u00a0 For example, after the 1996 Conferences, there was no guarantee the Citizen Advisors'\u00a0recommendations on policies would actually influence public officials.\u00a0 But,\u00a0after\u00a0the 2007/2008 Conferences, a summary of\u00a0the Citizen Advisors' recommendations were directly added to\u00a0the\u00a0New Mexico\u00a02030 Multimodal Transportation Plan, allowing for influence on public officials.</p><p>The deliberative method of citizen conferences has proven to be successful in allowing citizens to share their concerns and address their government, as there have been no problems with the method or\u00a0with this\u00a0specific\u00a0event\u00a0noted.</p><p><em>Note: An analysis of this case study\u00a0cannot be completed\u00a0until the outcomes and effects are known.\u00a0 Please assist\u00a0us in\u00a0completing the \"Influence, Outcomes, and Effects section.\"\u00a0</em></p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1.\u00a0\"New Mexico 2030 Statewide Multimodal Transportation Plan.\" New Mexico Department of Transportation, n.d.

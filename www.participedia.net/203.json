The roots of MySociety is in James Crabtree's article \u201cCivic Hacking: A New Agenda for E-Democracy\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a> published in OpenDemocracy in 2003. Steinberg relied on the ideas of the article by setting up mySociety outside of government and attempting to directly empower the civil society. MySociety has two pronounced missions: \u201cThe first is to be a charitable project which builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. The second is to teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to use the internet most efficiently to improve lives.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The organization attempts to build minimalistic websites which embody cheap scalability and tangible outputs. It is politically neutral and non-partisan. Nearly all its code is open source.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h1>History </h1><p>MySociety was founded in September 2003, and spent the first year raising money and looking for ideas. Its first funding arrived in September 2004, and before the end of 2005 it had three running projects: WriteToThem (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://writetothem.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://writetothem.com\">http://writetothem.com</a>), PledgeBank (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://pledgebank.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://pledgebank.com\">http://pledgebank.com</a>) and HearFromYourMP (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://hearfromyourmp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://hearfromyourmp.com\">http://hearfromyourmp.com</a>). In 2006 MySociety built and launched the No 10 Downing Street Petitions Website (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://petitions.number10.gov.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://petitions.number10.gov.uk\">http://petitions.number10.gov.uk</a>), FixMyStreet (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://fixmystreet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://fixmystreet.com\">http://fixmystreet.com</a>) and TheyWorkForYou (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://theyworkforyou.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://theyworkforyou.com\">http://theyworkforyou.com</a>). In 2008, it launched WhatDoTheyKnow (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://whatdotheyknow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://whatdotheyknow.com\">http://whatdotheyknow.com</a>) and started the FreeOurBills campaign (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/\">http://www.theyworkforyou.com/freeourbills/</a>).</p><p>Tom Steinberg is mySociety\u2019s founder and director. He\u2019s joined by three full-time developers, Angie Ahl, Francis Irving and Matthew Somerville, a system administrator (Keith) and a commercial director (Karl). The organization substantially relies on a volunteer help and encourages all kinds of contributions, including the possibility to run entire sites as part of MySociety (e.g., the PlanningAlerts website designed by Richard Pope). <a href=\"#cite_note-3\" title=\"\">[4]</a></p><p><a id=\"Major_projects\" name=\"Major_projects\"></a></p><h1>Major projects </h1><p><a id=\"TheyWorkForYou\" name=\"TheyWorkForYou\"></a></p><h2>TheyWorkForYou </h2><p>TheyWorkForYou <a href=\"#cite_note-4\" title=\"\">[5]</a> was originally built almost entirely by by a dozen of volunteers.

TheyWorkForYou provides citizens with a range of information on their politicians, such as: who their local MP is; what MPs said in Parliament; summaries of how MPs have voted; text of debates in Parliament; videos of MPs talking in debates; written questions MPs have submitted to government departments, and the answers they have got back; email alerts whenever an MP speaks, or a topic is mentioned in Parliament; comments and annotations from our users on what has been said, and more.</p><p>In July 2009, mySociety reported that the coverages of TheyWorkForYou has been extended to include the House of Commons debates starting from the 1935 general election and general information on MPs is available from the beginning of the 19th century.</p><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/organizations/Theyworkforyou.jpg\"/><br/>TheyWorkForYou</p><p>Along with the UK Parliament, the project also covers the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Welsh Assembly.

The creator of a petition can decide for how long she wants to keep it open (the longest period being 12 months). One can add his signature to an existing petition by providing the same details (name, address and email). Once a petition is closed, usually provided there are 500 signatures or more, it is passed to officials who work for the Prime Minister in Downing Street, or sent to the relevant Government department for a response. Every person who signs such a petition receives an email detailing the Government's response to the issues raised. <a href=\"#cite_note-16\" title=\"\">[17]</a> Government responses to popular petitions are the rule rather than the exception to it, and petitions with as few as 101 signatures have received official responses.</p><p>As of October 2009, there are over 4,600 open petitions, and almost 35,000 petitions created since the creation of the website. According to mySociety, \u201cfor legal and anti-spam reasons this site cannot host every petition submitted, but the rule is to accept everything that meets the terms and conditions of use. No petition will be rejected unless it violates these terms. And even when petitions cannot be hosted No10 will still publish as much of rejected petitions as is consistent with legal and anti-spam requirements, including the reason why it could not be hosted.\u201d <a href=\"#cite_note-17\" title=\"\">[18]</a> It is currently not possible to \u201csign against\u201d an open petition.</p><p>The largest petition to date garnered over 1.8 million signatures and asked for the intervention of a planned vehicle tracking and road pricing scheme.

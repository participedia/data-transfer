{"htmlbody": "<h3>Definition</h3><p>Americans Elect is a nonprofit nonpartisan organization whose goal is to \u201cfix the way we elect our leaders\u201d by implementing the first non partisan, national online presidential primary. Americans Elect has focused on achieving three clear goals:</p><ul><li>Gaining nationwide ballot access for a third presidential ticket to compete in the 2012 race;</li><li>Holding the first ever nonpartisan secure national online primary at AmericansElect.org;</li><li>Fielding a credible, balanced, unaffiliated ticket for the 2012 presidential race.</li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p><u>Purpose</u>: To offer more viable third party options to the American public.</p><p>The founders all felt that the status quo is broken; they are exasperated with partisan politics. They wanted a new solution and they felt like a radically new approach would reset the political scene. Two of their core ideas - the importance of a centrist, bi-partisan approach to the solving of our nation's problems and the possibility of an independent, unity ticket for the presidency.\u00a0</p><p><u>Problems</u>: One of the many problems with Americans Elect is exposure.</p><p>The reason that the organization suspended itself until 2013 was they weren\u2019t able to get enough American political interest in the general population for their vision. This same lack of interest eventually made them unable to champion a candidate to go on the ballot and declared \u201cno candidate had reached the required level of national support to qualify for Americans Elect's online convention.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody had come close to meeting the minimal threshold of 10,000 votes to win the Americans Elect online primary.\u00a0</p><p>Partisanship was a serious problem with the movement. Not too long after they dropped their plans to offer a third party candidate for the 2008 presidential election, they told the press that they would focus on other campaign issues. They then targeted some of their funding towards partisan advertisements in the years leading up to 2012, such as encouragement for the Simpson-Bowles commission to control deficit spending.\u00a0</p><p>The group has met with skepticism within the Washington beltway because there has been a backlash of criticism based on the traditional third party argument; people see this as another way to take away disproportional votes from one of the two main parties which could create a counterproductive scenario. \u00a0The group, Americans Elect, failed to generate interest in possible campaigns from Sens. Joe Lieberman and Lamar Alexander, and its intensive outreach to a host of other prospective candidates, including former Nebraska Sens. Chuck Hagel and Bob Kerrey, didn\u2019t yield much political \u201cbuzz\u201d for its efforts.\u00a0</p><p>Buddy Roemer, former Democratic governor from Louisiana and former Republican presidential candidate, who on a prime facie basis, fulfilled the politically expansive profile Americans Elect was seeking, topped the list of \"declared candidates.\"\u00a0He had 4,354 on-line support clicks, placing him squarely in the lead of this race, but he failed\u00a0to qualify for the Americans Elect candidacy before the group withdrew from the 2012 campaign. It was common conjecture that Americans Elect leadership determined that Governor Roemer\u2019s pedigree and maverick positions (e.g. legalized gambling) did not fit neatly into the worldviews of the organization's donors.\u00a0</p><p>The most successful candidate on the \"draft\" side, was Ron Paul, who came the closest to the mark with 9,330 \"support clicks\u201d. Ron Paul was considered a political outlier, whose nomination would undoubtedly never have cleared American Elect\u2019s nine-member board of directors, which Phil Ackerman put together and bestowed $5 Million in seed money.\u00a0 The directors retain the right to vet and even veto the candidates to spare the organization embarrassment and even mutiny.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>The history of Americans Elect begins with Unity08, a political movement that attempted to reform the political system by giving voters a viable nonpartisan \u201cthird party option in the 2008 presidential elections.\" The group was created by political figures, Doug Bailey, former President Carter Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, and Gerald Rafshoon, and was made up of Democrats and Republicans who wanted to see a change in the status quo, transitioning away from highly polarized leadership and towards a future where Americans had more power to affect the political system.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Unity08 fizzled out with time after the founders, Doug and Rafshoon, quit the team to \u201cdraft Mr. Bloomberg\u201d as a potential candidate for President as an alternative to the 2008 election calculus.</p><p>Peter Ackerman and Kahlil Byrd established Americans Elect in 2010 as a continuation of Unity08. The goal of Americans Elect was to create the first \u201cnonpartisan, national online presidential primary.\" They refined the \u201cField of Dreams \u2013 Build It and They Will Come\u201d strategy to be different from the Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, John Anderson, and Theodore Roosevelt third-party models where the candidate came first, and the money and organization followed. What Americans Elect was trying to do was the reverse.\u00a0 Ackerman and Bird were out to build an organization and handle the tedious task of getting the party on the ballot in every state, all in hopes of enticing an \u201cA\u201d List candidate.\u00a0</p><p>Many were optimistic 2012 was the year because there was general unhappiness in the electorate over Congress and the legislature\u2019s gridlock and lack of accomplishment.\u00a0 To not drum up enthusiasm for a third-party in a year like this when neither candidate was prohibitively popular, was almost resignation that a third-party renaissance in American politics will continue to be put off.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p><u>Delegates:</u></p><p>Every American citizen committed to improving the political process at the Federal government can join the process. \u00a0Americans Elect delegates can be any registered voter who signs up online to choose a presidential ticket through successive rounds of Internet voting. Americans Elect\u2019s open membership policies garnered just shy of eligible delegates to be included in the selection process.\u00a0</p><p><u>Candidates:</u></p><p>Much of the attraction associated with becoming a delegate is that delegates and not party leaders have full control of who is drafted as a candidate. Their criterion for possible presidential selection included proverbial qualifications such as being a United States Senator, a president of an organization with a large member base, a ranked military officer, Governors, Cabinet portfolios, etc. Such lofty credentials qualifications were not necessary in the end because all constitutionally eligible United States citizens are permitted to run for President of the United States.\u00a0</p><p><u>Nominee:</u></p><p>In order to qualify for the primary ballot, a single candidate with the qualifications listed above needed only 10,000 support clicks from ten different states. The initial phase of voting was intended to weed the competition down to six contenders. \u00a0If any ticket received a majority they would immediately become the nominee. Without that being the case, the top two individuals who received the most votes would face off in another round of voting to determine the nominee.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interactions</h3><p>This group received substantial media coverage during the beginning of their organization. It slowly tapered off as time went on and a candidate didn\u2019t emerge.\u00a0Political movements are typically built around compelling personalities or causes, but not technology, and neither personality or causes materialized for Americans Elect.\u00a0Despite widespread discontent with the two-party system and near-record numbers of people saying that they would be open to voting for a third-party candidate, the future of another major political party emerging after the failure of Americans Elect to field a viable candidate in 2012 appears impractical.\u00a0</p><p>The perception in many politico circles is this was a dubious end for a group that carried a number of high-profile backers in the political strategist and donor community\u00a0and who, as of earlier this month, had secured ballot access in more than half of the 50 states. Elections in a Republic like the United States are winner take all with the Electoral College, so there will be a clear victor elected, without all the coalition-building that comes with a parliamentary system. Like any other secular industry selling homogenous goods or services with a high barrier to entry like commercial aircraft, high-speed mainframe computers and political parties, usually duopolies emerge, e.g. Boeing vs. Airbus, Cray vs. IBM, Republicans versus Democrats.\u00a0 The only dynamic that might not force voters into two camps may be non-secular in origin, which is something Unity08 wanted to avoid at all costs.\u00a0</p><p>There are lots of small \u201cthird parties\u201d out there, but they rarely win major elections. The few political \u201cindependents\u201d in Congress, like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, are people who get elected not because of some structure someone else set up, but through their own political skill. And they end up caucusing with one party or the other anyway, as Senator Sanders caucuses\u00a0with the Democrats.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>There hadn\u2019t been a credible third-party candidate since 1992 when Texas businessman, Ross Perot, garnered an impressive 19% of the popular vote and created a novel dynamic and uncertainty among the pundits in the race between President George Herbert Bush and Governor Bill Clinton.\u00a0 Ross Perot also ran for president as a third-party candidate in 1996, but his backing had dwindled to only 9% of the electorate.\u00a0</p><p>The defection of Bailey and Rafshoon supplanted Unity08 of much its mainstream support on behalf of a third-party strategy largely because the notion of \u201cDraft Blomberg\u201d was met initially with a fair amount of enthusiasm. However, a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/poll-some-would-draft-bloomberg-for-governor/\">\u00a0</a>found that 61 percent of New Yorkers thought Mr. Bloomberg had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to serve out his full term, and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s reluctance to seize the possibility were catalysts in their \u201ccause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u201d to dissipate almost as fast as it was proposed.\u00a0</p><p>Americans Elect tried to immediately distinguish themselves from the fractionalized 2008 Bloomberg courtship.\u00a0 Right out of the gate, within its first few hours of business to select a nominee through a 2012 online primary, Americans Elect\u2019s 360,000 delegates drafted 52 candidates for president, including well-recognized politicians such as Michael Bloomberg, Jon Huntsman, Buddy Roemer, Warren Buffett, Rahm Emanuel and Condoleezza Rice. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>What frustrated follow-on actions from advancing this impressive list was the manifest complexity of the process.\u00a0 The delegates could anticipate beginning three rounds of online voting to narrow the field to six candidates. \u00a0The ultimate winner would be selected in June as the Americans Elect nominee and will appear on the ballot in November.\u00a0 Their running mate would have to be a past member of the opposing political party of the nominee.\u00a0 For instance, if George Stephanopoulos, a former Democrat, was the nominee, a Republican like Condoleezza Rice would be slotted as the vice-presidential candidate. That many conflicting ideologies on the same ticket projected a risky partnership; the actual task of governing for leaders who were political incompatible would result in something as dysfunctional as the Democratic or Republicans parties may do on their own. \u00a0</p><p>The result was a hardening of conventional wisdom that a third-party movement will not take much more than a pox-on-both-your-parties sentiment or a single-issue crusade for the effort to succeed. It will also require a compelling candidate and a convincing, comprehensive platform. And it will require money \u2014 perhaps several hundred million dollars \u2014 to compete with the financial power of the major parties. \u201cThis is a very, very major organizational undertaking,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s like building an army from scratch. And how you do that without significant resources \u2014 organizational resources, monetary resources, intellectual resources.\u201d Unfortunately, in era of 30-second \u201csound bites,\u201d over-complication contributed to failing to generate enough interest in the concept. \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>At first Unity08 was a \u201cmedia darling\u201d story because their premise was so simplistic and its simplicity made the idea plausible.\u00a0 A group of political consultants, both Democratic and Republican, proposed a presidential ticket comprise of one candidate from each side of the partisan divide. The founders of Unity08 believed their best chance for momentum was to mine support from the prevalent dissatisfaction from the public\u2019s view that neither the Democratic nor the Republican leaders are doing enough to put the country in the right direction.</p><p>Unity08 said it could win by stressing an outsider\u2019s commitment to tackling problems the parties haven\u2019t solved \u2014 partly because of the long run of divided government but also, the outsiders say, because both parties are motivated to emphasize partisanship in the cause of self-preservation. \u201cGood and qualified people see politics as so poisonous today that they simply don\u2019t want to participate,\u201d explained Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and a major player in the Americans Elect movement. \u201cIt\u2019s just damn difficult to break the iron grip of the two-party system.</p><p>The irony about Americans Elect to date is the view the only way to repair the perception of flawed democracy involves secret money. There also arises a serious question as to whether an organization whose stated aim is to participate in the presidential election \u2014 and has qualified <em>as a political party</em> on state ballots \u2014 can claim it is a nonprofit organization not required to disclose donors. Americans Elect argues that secrecy is necessary because its underwriters fear retaliation for challenging the political status quo. Its eventual nominee will comply with ordinary rules requiring disclosure and limiting contributions.</p><p>The one tangibly positive upshot of Americans Elect, is that it propelled one of its founders, Angus King, into the victor\u2019s circle as the newest Senator from Maine.\u00a0 Angus King has served earlier as an independent Governor of Maine.\u00a0 True to his conviction, Senator-elect King ran as an independent candidate and earned more votes from registered Democrats than the official Democratic nominee.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0Vogel, Kenneth P. and Abby Phillip, \u201cAmericans Elect 2012 presidential run: The\u00a0third-party group has cash, but no candidate,\u201d\u00a0<u>Politico</u>, 13 January 2012, 21 October\u00a02012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71399.html&gt;\">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71399.html&gt;</a>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <u>Unity -08: The Re-United States of America</u>, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.unity08.com/&gt;\">http://www.unity08.com/&gt;</a>.</p><p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <u>Americans Elect: Pick a President, Not a Party</u>, &lt;AmericansElect.org&gt;.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>4.\u00a0Bailey, Doug, \u2018\u201dUnity \u201808\u201d Seeks Third Party,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 27 June 2006,\u00a021 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/15/DI2006061501406.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/15/DI200...</a>.</p><p>5.\u00a0Chan, Sewell, \u201dTime for the Mayor to Make Up His Mind,\u201d <u>The New York Times</u>, 11 January 2008, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/\">http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/</a> time-for-the-mayor-to-make-up-his-mind/.</p><p>6.\u00a0Giroux, Greg, \u201cFrom CQ Weekly: Third-Party Push by Unity \u201908 a Matter of Hope vs. History, <u>The New York Times</u>, 7 May 2007, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/05/07/cq_2681.html?pagewanted=print&gt;\">http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/05/07/cq_2681.html?pagewanted=print&gt;</a>.</p><p>7.\u00a0Cilliza, Chris and Aaron Blake, \u201cAmericans Elect and the death of the third party movement,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 18 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/americans-elect-and-the-death-of-the-third-party-movement/2012/05/17/gIQAIzNKXU_blog.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/americans-elect-and-the...</a>.</p><p>8.\u00a0Linkens, Jason, \u201cLate Returns: Americans Elicet Candidates Still Not Doing Well,\u201d <u>Huffington Post</u>, 2 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/</a> 2012/05/02/late-returns-candidates-not-doing-well_n_1472654.html&gt;.</p><p>9.\u00a0Linkins, Jason, \u201cAmericans Elect?\u00a0 More Like American\u2019t Elect,\u201d <u>Huffington Post</u>,15 May 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/\u00a0\u00a0\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/15/\u00a0\u00a0</a> americans-elect-candidate-deadline_n_518060.html&gt;.</p><p>10.\u00a0Meyerson, Harold, \u201cDon\u2019t let Americans Elect muddy the 2012 race,\u201d <u>The Los Angeles Times</u>, 20 March 2012, 21 October 2012, &lt;<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/\">http://articles.latimes.com/2012/</a> mar/20/opinion/la-oe-meyerson-americans-elect-20120320&gt;.</p><p>11.\u00a0Marcus, Ruth, \u201cAmericans Elect: A wild card for the Internet age,\u201d <u>The Washington Post</u>, 27 December 2011, 21 October 2012,&lt;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-elect-a-wild-card-for-the-internet-age/2011/12/27/gIQAPYlILP_story.html&gt;\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/americans-elect-a-wild-card-for-t...</a>.</p><p>12.\u00a0Douthat, Ross, \u201cThe Third Party Fantasy,\u201d <u>The New York Times</u>, 15 May 2012, 21October 2012,&lt;

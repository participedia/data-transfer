Don't let a glitch or accident eat your carefully-crafted article or comment! The longer your contribution, the sadder it would be to lose it by accidentally reloading the page! We strongly encourage you to draft any content in a text editor (such as TextPad or TextEdit) and copy-and-paste your text into Participedia. If you use Word, please copy-and-paste from Word to a plain text editor (e.g. TextPad), and then copy-and-paste from there into Participedia; Word text often includes hidden code that can mess up the formatting of your contribution.<br/>\u00a0</p><h2>Other ways to participate</h2><p>You can support Participedia's growth in many other ways, too.\u00a0<a href=\"/contact\">Give us feedback</a>\u00a0on how to make the site better.

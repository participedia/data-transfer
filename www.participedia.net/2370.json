Immersion in the community</h3><p>The first step to achieving the development of the citizen action project is community immersion. The creation of confidence, respect, competency and work between members of the community and others as a part of a team is of utmost importance.</p><p>The community is a group of people who share something in common such as customs, values, duties, geographical location, etc., which are fundamental in creating a unique identity which separates them from other groups.</p><p>It was decided that a project would be completed in the community of las Brisas since it was easily accessible and important contacts had already been established. It was concluded that there were not any noticeable limits present in terms of temporarily becoming part of the community, especially since this is an essential part of observing any group.</p><p>The used strategies in approaching the community were getting to know the community physically and establishing contact. Considering that one of the team members, Raul, already belonged to the community, a certain general idea of how to do this was present. It was nonetheless necessary to get to know it and to create a certain amount of confidence. It was therefore decided that visiting, and getting to know the community was necessary. We did this first by approach Mrs. Rosalina (Raul\u2019s mother), which facilitated knowing who we should address in order to conform to the customs of the settlers and induce them in order to achieve something for the community. She therefore introduced us to Mr. Adolfo Siller, a member of the community who knows very much about it and its various inhabitants.</p><p>Thanks to Mrs. Rosalina we were able to talk to him and the clarified the objective in the project, which is the organization and support of different activities seeking to realize and sway the community toward problems which could be improved; and this is also the reason why we chose this community. There was a feeling that a solid contact has been created as long as we showed a good attitude, respect, and a will to help.</p><p>After becoming a bit more aware of the community, it was decided that that we would use various tool in order to be effectively linked and in contact with it. We created a map of the community to know its streets, its organization, its major features, number of families. The last part is important since it is important for members of the community to see our interest in and knowledge of the community in order to create a certain amount of confidence and to be able to participate in it.</p><p>On the other hand we decided to interview Mr. Adolfo Siller in order to get to know the community a bit better, to see what type of improvement activities had been completed, if there was a link between any members in those projects, etc. Additionally, we used a checklist of questions about the community. Mr. Siller mentioned, broadly, recent troubles among certain neighbors due to various problems in the community as well as general features of the community.</p><p>Interview:</p><ol><li>Who makes up the community? How many members are there? For how long have they belonged to the community?</li></ol><p>There are about 120 families and they\u2019ve lived here for different amount of time since there are after all some new neighbors. There are people who have lived here in Las Brisas for than 25 years. It\u2019s a middle class community, to say it simply.</p><ol><li value=\"2\">What type of people belong to the community? (adults, young people, students, professionals, employees, etc.)</li></ol><p>The majority are adults, although lately young people have come to live here.</p><ol><li value=\"3\">Which professions do they have?</li></ol><p>Some are pensioners, other are lawyers, accountants, small business owners, among other things.</p><ol><li value=\"4\">They feel like they are part of the community?</li></ol><p>The community is as a whole very unified, and so yes, they consider themselves part of it.</p><ol><li value=\"5\">Have the members of the community worked in a collaborative in the past?</li></ol><p>We have in the past stated that no, although we found out in the second to last meeting that a group of neighbors had been working on the upkeep of the park, among other activities. Although, there were not very many individuals were involved in this.</p><ol><li value=\"6\">Is there a certain worry among inhabitations concerning various problems in the community?</li></ol><p>There are many who complain about the insecurity, noise, traffic, etc. Nonetheless, we don\u2019t know of a principal problem affecting everyone.</p><p>Immediately after doing the interview we decided, together with the representative, call for a weekly meetings (Thursdays at 8:00) during which some members of the community would assist in order to speak about any worries in the community. It was decided that Mr. Siller, among other neighbors, would invite us to attend.</p><p>After applying the tools of immersion, visiting, and getting to know the community, we realized that this was a very unified and peaceful place; especially after noticing that various neighbors from different blocks had a very close relationship. It has various parks which are found in more or less good condition, houses are in good shape \u2013 which tells us that these are individuals from the middle-upper class \u2013 the people who we interacted with were kind and well-educated. Each sectors has approximately 120 families who have lived there for a long time, which basically tells us that it\u2019s a place where individuals feel comfortable and would not be opposed to bettering it.</p><p>In general this what we realized in this step. At the beginning we felt a bit unsure, but once we assisted, acquainted ourselves, and spoke with some member of the community we began to feel motivated and sure that we could help to make a chance. We hoped that little by little the same members of the community would participate in order to combat the problems facing them.</p><h3>Step 2. Social Research</h3><p>The social research followed our immersion into the community, which allowed us to have a deeper understand of the people who inhabit it. To develop it was necessary to develop more organization and transparent communication between all parties.\u00a0 It was very important to establish strategies to help the community to identify its most pressing concerns. Nonetheless, before starting the meeting we did a general analysis concerning the data we collected during the first step in order to have a proper understanding of the community.</p><p>Use of important data for the project</p><ol><li>Who makes up the community?</li></ol><p>It was decided that we would establish geographic limits to the project as las Brisas is a very big place; this was done with the aim of receiving more considerable results and changes. A specific sector of the community was chosen, which includes about 150 homes. The specific delineations are featured in the sourced map.</p><p>B. How many people live in the community?</p><p>About 550 people, including children and adults.</p><p>C. Where is it located?</p><p>In Acapulco boulevard on the Garza Sada side.</p><p>D. Who are the individuals of most influence in the community?</p><p>People who have already lived here a long time as well as people who have taken part in youth meetings.</p><p>e. What type of influence do they exercise?</p><p>They exercise a form of communicative influence and are in charge of informing others and then they discuss problem which affect them as a society. They allow them to see that they can work together for, among other things, a cleaner, more organized and safer community.</p><p>f. Who could be collaborators in the implementation of the participatory project?</p><p>A state agency, some business located nearby, the same people, etc.</p><p>g. Who could get in the way of progress?</p><p>Such individual do not exist; there is only the issue that some people are not involved as actively.</p><p>h. What are some of the identifiable values of some people?</p><p>Communication, respect, service, and tolerance.</p><ol><li>What are some the community\u2019s interests?</li></ol><p>Resolving its problems.</p><p>As we had mentioned in the previous, some meetings were organized with the community every Thursday at 9 o\u2019clock at night, where all were meant to give their point of view concerning different problems by which the community of Las Brisas founded itself affected. It was necessary to know those point of views and analyze the principal problem affecting the community.</p><p>During the nightly meeting it became clear to us that many people were interested in resolving many problems which affect the community. About 24 people of the community\u2019s 120 families attended, nonetheless those 24 people informed the others who cannot attend of what took place. We can therefore say that a kind of social chain developed.</p><p>We first decided to elect 5 leaders during the meeting, which we did through voting. All attendees were able to vote and we decided that this be the best solution as we do not belong to this community. The vote was open as we said the name of the person who wished to be a representative and all of those who wished that he/she be a representative raised their hands. Nonetheless, there were six principal leaders who will attend all the meetings and will inform everyone of what has been discussed. Adolfo Siller, the president, followed by Eustolio Cano as vice president, Victor Vigueras as substitute vice president, Rosy Garza, Julia Rivera and Mayra Rodriguez as representatives of the population.</p><p>After the selection of the leaders various problems affecting inhabitants of the community were discussed. We completed interviews in order to exactly know what each person was thinking and to later complete an analysis with the representatives to identify three principal problems. The members of the community accepted to answer the questions and we were delighted to see their interest. The questions we asked were: \u201cWhat do you not liked about your community?\u201d \u201cWould you like to change it?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d All went on to provide their point of view in what turned into a downpour of ideas, whereby we wrote down each mentioned problem and how many people supported fixing this problem. This strategy was highly appealing to us because each person said what they thought, what bothered them, which problems they had, etc.</p><p>After people commented on problems affecting them, we selected three problems according to amount of people who had the same problem in common. These problems were: trash, security and traffic.</p><p>This step was based on identifying problems affecting the community. We liked that every person was able to comment and give their point of view concerning each problem. We believe we are creating a good amount of contact with members of the community, but nonetheless we would like that more individuals participate so everyone can be taken into account and participate. We spoke with each representative about this matter so they can invite the rest to participate in the meetings.</p><h3>Step 3. Identification, Analysis, and Problem Selection</h3><p>As we already mention, the community\u2019s leaders were formed starting from the first official meeting which we had with the community. This is the strategy we used to that everyone could give their point of view (president, vice president, representatives). We spoke with these individuals concerning the importance of defining the problems which affect the community of Las Brisas, seeing this as a moment of reliability, feasibility, impact, etc. (leaders convened every Thursday).</p><p>It was through this dynamic that an attempt was made to open leaders\u2019 minds so that they could understand that there could be other problems of equal importance to that of security and in each case continue with the project. This activity was designed to give them the opportunity to see the whole panorama of what represents the solution of a problem which everyone has in common.</p><p>We explained to them the selection matrix of the problem and that of the impact vs. reliability and they filled it out.</p><p>We found that with these tables and matrices that many of the problems were not very feasible and had low impact; e.g. the traffic problem whose solution were basically impossible and necessitated help from the government and traffic security, etc, in order to achieve something would help many but also leave other left out seeing that traffic closes at one point and comes out another, which would basically mean that it would have low feasibility and low impact. On the other hand, the trash problem was a problem which had very achievable solution, but does not have a high level of impact as many people can see it as a problem of little need as well as a problem which will not lead to a big change.\u00a0 We were slowly able to realize which was the problem of most need, ability, impact, and feasibility through analyzing problems through impact vs. feasibility table as well as the matrix where each problem is qualified.</p><p>After seeing every point on the tables, we decided to choose the one result which was the most important in terms of its level of feasibility, gravity, and impact; this was the problem of security.</p><p>After selecting the principal problem, we went on by analyzing what was behind this problem, what effects it had, how many were affected, etc.\u00a0 The conclusions we came to were that one of the cases that there are vandalistic groups or \u201ccholos\u201d. Various accounts also held that the \u201ccholos\u201d bought off the police so that they were able to steal, something that deals greatly with the problem of corruption. Furthermore, many representatives recounted stories of theft as well as the great discomfort that comes with this problem. Many people started to give solution which could end this problems. Regardless, a more complete analysis will be completed later which will provide solutions to the problem as well as which steps should be followed.</p><p>We noticed that the inhabitants of the community see themselves very affected due to the problem of insecurity since their stories were often told with anger as well as the frustration of not being able to live in peace. The necessity and will among everyone to end this problem was very present.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Step 4. Planning for action.</h3><p>In order to complete this step it was necessary to coordinate a reunion with members of the community and to apply certain public information strategies. Nonetheless, we already had set plans to have weekly meetings to speak, organize, and comment on activities or successes which had been achieved in the community.</p><p>The meeting the past Thursday focused on what was necessary to start planning for action to solve the problem; comments were also made concerning the logical framework matrix, nonetheless there was no noticeable interest in developing in or at least comments and questions concerning it. Many members of the community started to give idea concerning the solutions which could be made and also began to decide which actions were achievable. Unfortunately, there was no organizational framework for this. This was the appropriate moment to once again bring up the necessity to carry out a work plan, seeing that we could use the example of the disorganization which they were experiencing in that very moment.</p><p>Members of the community quickly realize the error they were committing by not properly organizing or defining what they were trying to do. They therefore finally showed interest in the planning which we told them was of necessity. Various members asked what the matrix was, what it would to solving problems, and what advantages were had by answering it. We informed them about this and we then decided to convene next Tuesday with the same leaders to solve the issue of the matrix and the work plan.</p><p>At that Tuesday meeting we decided that members of the community would be able to choose the way in which they would want to answer the matrix. The majority decided that we should guide the process by filling them out while they commented and then later analyze the result to define everything in a more competent manner.</p><p>The development process for the matrix was very successful. Everyone was able to properly define the goal and purpose of the project, nonetheless there were some differences of opinion in the elements and activities. Many mentioned that they would like to hire police so that they could watch over the sector while others rejected this by mentioning that these service was not safe considering the level of corruption which currently exists in the country. On the other hand, comments were made that cameras as well as a security booth could be installed in the community. They also exchanged ideas which advocated giving carwash personnel and service staff identification badges in order to know who they are. We told them concerning what advantages, disadvantages and complications their suggested solutions could have.</p><p>After having a grand opinion-based discussion, elements and activities were defined. It was decided that police was be contracted, nonetheless, in order to prevent the problem of corruption, it was decided to go to the Secretariat of Public Security to talk about the problem, request the police force and ask which ideas and elements could be made a part of the government of the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.</p><p>Now that we had defined the actions which would be achieved, the work plan in which each leader and representative of the community would say would be the most easy to do would be debate. The date of creating an agreement in accordance with the necessity of the action\u2019s time was always discussed. The results of the work plan table and the logical framework matrix are found below.</p><p>This step was very important in the project since if there was no proper organization in the project it is highly probable that it will fail. The type of work as well as the participation of each member was very successful. We hope to have a highly successful plan in accordance with how everything advances.</p><h3>Step 5: Mapping of social capital / contact and support of stakeholders</h3><p>The social capital in the society is made up by\u2026</p><ul><li>Neighbors in the vicinity with or without accessible income \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</li></ul><ul><li>The safety committee</li></ul><ul><li>Nearby business</li></ul><ul><li>Sponsors (Berel, Gilsa, etc.)</li></ul><ul><li>Workers (car washers, gardeners, journalists, etc.(</li></ul><ul><li>Other people (ADT, undersecretary of public safety, public works, etc.)</li></ul><ul><li>Authorities</li></ul><p>Neighbors are particularly necessary for this project since without their interest or participation it is not possible to do anything. The Safety Committee is very necessary since it is the leaders who participate, organize and conduct principal activities, furthermore they inform the rest of the neighbors concerning progress in the project. Business and sponsors importance because when they participate they can give has an essential amount of funding for the project. The workers do not live in the community but nonetheless are part of it and frequent it often. These individuals could be considered suspects of theft and assault, which are the principal problems in our project. Authorities are necessary in our PAC since they are in charge of providing permits, help and opinions concerning the activities which could be done in order to achieve our objective.</p><p>These are without a doubt the individuals upon whom we rely to develop the Citizen Action Group Project (PAC).</p><p>As we have already mentioned, we had already organized all meeting since the beginning of this project and we showed the dynamics we followed.</p><p>Most of the people already knew us with the exception of some neighbors who had not attended. On average 10 to 25 people attend the meetings on Tuesdays or Thursdays according to case. They are nonetheless held responsible for informing themselves. There are always open invitations to all neighbors so that they can attend and inform themselves more.</p><p>On the 5th of September, a meeting with the Secretariat of Public Safety took place, which the president of the Committee, Adolfo Siller, attended. The president brought a circular letter in which backgrounds and petitions of the community were mentioned as well as containing signatures by the inhabitants. Chief Fernando Torre y Cuevas responded to the president\u2019s concerns and invited him, as a solution to the problem, to the Neighborhood Police program, which is implemented in 55 neighborhoods and consists of a cooperation between the state government and the inhabitant (Annex 3)</p><p>On the other hand, Mrs. Rosalina Garza, committee member, contacted Juan de Dios Saucedo, who is member of the Multi-Systems of Industrial safety Group (MSI) so that he could inform himself about this group. De Dios Saucedo gave out a booklet which mentions the major functions and advantages of the MSI (Annex 4).</p><p>A meeting with Ram\u00f3n de la Pe\u00f1a was set to take place in order to facilitate the application process for permits for the security booth, but this could not take place October 1 due to certain mishaps, but work is being completed on this.</p><p>All members of the committee, representatives, and various neighbors gave their points of view in a direct way and they are fully committed to participating. Conversely, security authorities committed themselves to giving all support necessary once it is completely ready to implement the project of neighborhood police. For the time being patrol groups are passing at different hours until an automobile and a security booth is provided.</p><p>In addition to ourselves, the six principal leaders from the committee as well as the directors of its (Adolfo Siller, Eustolio Cano, V\u00edctor Viqueras, Rosy Garza, Julia Rivera y Josefa Villarreal) as well as representatives from each block and the neighbors who are willing to participate or who wished to inform themselves on the project will participate in the next community meeting (September Tuesday 25). In this next meeting, in addition to motivating inhabitants to participate, progress on activities set to be completed will be a topic of information (among others, matrix, program).</p><h3>Step 6 Community Meeting</h3><p>Around 100 people participated in the community meeting which took place in the garage in Mayra\u2019s home. Chairs and a microphone were all asked for by the organizers. We were very pleased by the large turnout as we started to notice a marked increase in interest by the community. The principal objective was mentioning the way in which action will take place, what members are planning to do, as well as the citizens\u2019 motivation so that they can call for necessary economic aid to achieve this.</p><p>Laura Hinojosa was the documentarian in this meeting since she is in charge of writing down the principal points at the source of the meeting. Ra\u00fal Garza was the facilitator since he was in charge of supporting the committee and resolving conflicts throughout the meeting. Eduardo Dantes was the Operative Support since he was in charge of giving his support to us as well as to those on the committee.</p><p>Before beginning with the meeting that was given, in accordance to how people arrive, the sheet with the information on the Supervisory Committee and a sheet with a map of the community highlighted the blocks which were the focus to achieving the goal of the program.</p><p>The order of the day went as follows:</p><ol><li>Give an introduction to the meeting (Adolfo Siller), present the six committee leaders, name the representatives in each block (so that inhabitants know who is their representative) and mention the objective of the meeting.</li><li>Mention obtained achievements (meeting with the Public Safety Secretariat)</li><li>Shine light on activities which are still to be done (Narrative summary of objectives)</li><li>Mention elements and the budget for each one (indicators)</li><li>Motivate the inhabitants to participate, mention the advantage to this.</li><li>Highlight the need for economic support by everyone</li><li>Present the contribution that would be asked for by each home</li><li>Give the floor so doubts, comments and declarations can be heard.</li><li>Conclusion</li></ol><p>During the Community Meeting, the order which was decided upon in the agenda was followed. It began 5 minutes later than the decided upon time to give opportunity to those who left their homes late. The inhabitants were attentive, there was no need to silence anyone, and the microphone was very helpful in terms of the amount of people that appeared.</p><p>Adolfo Siller was the one who really orchestrated the meeting, although the 6 principal committee members also participation through small declarations. This was the done with the goal of not losing the attention of the inhabitants while so many different people spoke.</p><p>Visual support was very simple, although we did feel that they were instrumental in involving people more and creating different points of view which are occasionally suppressed since often only a few inhabitants speak. When using this support we witnessed more participation.</p><p>A summary with information of how any police neighborhood program in another community (Sierra los Leones) functioned. These was obtained by Mrs. Rosalina (neighbor in the community).</p><p>Notes were taken in a flip chart so that everyone could clearly see what was being and what will be done in a structured manner.</p><p>A map of the community was made (various drafts were turned in) so that other places of the security booth\u2019s installation could be discussed (one choice already existed, but it was important to keep debating or to see if there was a better option).</p><p>It was worth reiterating the microphone was used to great efficacy so all people could listen.</p><p>The following agreements have been agreed upon for the implementation of the project:</p><p>It is considered very important that inhabitants participate, beyond anything economically so that an automobile can be purchased and the security booth can be installed. In order to do this, some\u00a0 vouchers were completed with the following message:</p><p>\u201cContributions by each home in the community for the purchase of a surveillance vehicle as well as the maintenance, holding, and gasoline for a year.\u201d</p><p>The cost or contribution will be 1200 pesos (about 90 US dollars).</p><p>The money will be charged by every representative in the block, who will then provide money two one of the two appointed treasurers, Julia Rivera y Rosalina Garza. Each neighbor will receive a receipt of their payment as well as a sticker of verification.</p><p>It then became clear that the Neighborhood Police program would begin once the vehicle was purchase and the both was installed.</p><p>It was also agreed that if more than 70 percent of the block does not support the program and does not want to contribute to the project economically, that block will be out of the program. (This was done with the goal of having the same members of that block motivate those who do not want to participate).</p><p>It was also decided that there would be less meetings in the end in order to prevent fatigue. Due to this, information pamphlets or letters will be sent to neighbors so they can remain informed.</p><p>If there is any doubt or complaint, inhabitants can communicate with whichever leader of the director\u2019s table or with their block representative for clarifications (Information on the sheet provided by the Surveillance Committee)</p><p>It is hoped for that those in charge of the approval of each indicator will be the president and vice president of the committee (Adolfo Siller and Eustolio Cano). Nonetheless, this is a point needing clarification with the community\u2019s members.</p><h3>Step 7. Action Implementation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</h3><p>An inummerable amount of activities have been created for the action implementation; as much with corresponding authorities (public safety, public works, etc.) as with the same neighbors and the committee.</p><p>It was necessary to use a report for the creation of record books. This report would give proof to whichever neighbor of their investment, it would state which points are covered by the project as well as state on what money would be spent and invested. Once written, the record books began to be handed out among representatives of every block who would then commit to charging the corresponding money to each house. As we already mentioned, this amount came to a total of 1200 Mexican pesos.</p><p>On the other hand, concerning sponsors, Mrs. Rosalina Garza had been contacting an acquaintance of hers, Sergio Anguiano (Gilsa), who promised to build the security booth as a donation. Furthermore, an outline of the type of booth was provided to him, including its dimensions, facade, etc\u00a0 (Annex).</p><p>We received the permits ourselves with Mr. Eustolio Cano and other neighbors with Mr. Ram\u00f3n de la Pe\u00f1a on October 12. He mentioned to use that it was not be to his benefit to help us directly; seeing that the necessary work is divided between the state and the municipal village, and that the issues surrounding las Brisas would corresponded more to state agencies (Jos\u00e9 Natividad Gonz\u00e1les Par\u00e1s). Ram\u00f3n de la Pe\u00f1a committed himself to supporting the community and to send a corresponding letter with the permit requests for the installation of the security booth as well as for public services, etc.</p><p>Eustolio Can, on the other hand, spoke with architect Jes\u00fas Cant\u00fa (public works), who came by last week to complete an inspection of where the security booth will be placed and found that this was a valid and acceptable idea. He only asked for a map of the place as well as the security booth\u2019s design (both things were sent by email). The architect promised to report back, which he eventually did and approved the plans. He only asked that representatives go to the property with the charter of the association and that permit was already ready. Relatedly, there was a meeting with the accountant Patricia Mercado on October 16to speak about how to go forward in officially creating an association.</p><p>Currently 120,000 Mexican pesos have been collected, which have been deposited in a bank account and secured using four signatures. Contributions given by the neighborhoods have been promising, although about 50 percent of the neighbors have contributed through payments and others have been a bit slower to cooperate. We hope that by the end of the month there will be more contributions. The treasurer provided receipts to the individuals who have turned in money.</p><p>The purchase of the vehicle will occur once there is more capita since there is a common belief that if the car is purchased now many people who have not cooperated will not contributed.</p><h3>Monitoring Results</h3><p>For the car:</p><p>Up until now efforts have only been dedicated to seeking alternatives and options for vehicles that could be purchases as well as prices and models.</p><p>Research has also been committed to equipment, locks, etc., so that when the car is finally purchased everything can be done much more efficiently. Nonetheless, since there has been no action on this front, there is no way to verify information. Notwithstanding, the amount of money necessary for this has been collected and proof of this is in the record books.</p><p>For the security booth:</p><p>Discussions with corresponding authorities through Jesus Cantu (last contact in questions concerning the permit) are ongoing. He visited the community and decided upon the area in which the booth would be placed. Nonetheless, as we already mentioned in step 7, it was necessary that the community be registered and this is currently being work on.</p><p>Sponsorship has been settled and is now ready.</p><p>For the permit, it is not only necessary to go to the appropriate authorities with the charter of the association which allows them to see it as an association from the community.</p><p>Police:</p><p>The police is assigned by the state once the car and security booth are in place. We do not have photos or the credentials of these individuals.</p><p>Cameras:</p><p>Cameras have been left aside for the moment until we are able to acquire more essential items. This is because the committee is only in charge of the car, the security booth, and the police forces.</p><p>Report created for the community</p><p>The secretary, Mayra Rodriguez, is in charge of creating pamphlets which inform neighbors about the progress achieved so far as well as providing a certain number of pamphlets to block representatives so that they can deliver them to their neighbors (Annex 7)</p><h3>Step 9: Action Sustainability</h3><p>The community has responded positively throughout the project\u2019s duration. Nonetheless, it is necessary to develop tools in this last phase of the project so that members of the community can familiarize themselves with the PAC (Citizen Action Project). The project\u2019s sustainability has been growing thanks to the communication of some neighbors with other communities like the Col. Country, del Paseo Residencial, among others. We want to mention this seeing that Friday 26 neighbors of las Brisas were invited to participate in a meeting concerning the PAC in the community of del Paseo Residencial.</p><p>Around 15 neighbors attended this meeting, among theses were Mrs. Teresa Liscano who in 1990 was the president of the community. She was contracted by Mr. Eustoio (leader of the committee) with the goal of finalizing the transaction of the permits for the security booth as this individual is already registered alongside other neighbors as a civil association. She seemed very interested in participating. From this meeting onward it was decided that beside the surveillance committee, it was convenient to create an improvement committee or meeting in addition to matters of security, in which other problems such as lighting, gardening, among others would be discussed.</p><p>Following this line of events and seeing how some members of the community have responded, it was decided that the leader for the sustainability of the PAC would be Teresa Liscano, Maria de La Luz Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n (community member and teacher at the TEC) and Mr. Adolfo Siller with the support of the committee\u2019s members.</p><p>As we have already mentioned, it is necessary to register the committee as a civil association in order to be able to obtain the permit. Nonetheless, in accordance with the decision of the board of trustees of 1990 this will be much easier as it is no longer necessary to create a new one and this can one can be simply renewed. It is also the intention of the organizers to create a council which acts a monitor in order to evaluate the work of the security committee and everyone who participates in its implementation. This will be created once the project takes on a more concrete form. Even though there are already individuals who are supervising these actions, these activities are meant to eventually be formalized through a council.</p><p>The alliances upon which the community relies are the members of the Secretariat of Public Security of the State. They are going to be responsible alongside the residents concerning anything having to do with security. This alliance was developed since the first visit by the sub-director of the Secretariat, Mr. Torre y Cueva (A lot over this situation has already been mentioned as it exist with the authorities through what will eventually become the Neighborhood Police program).</p><p>Other alliances upon which the community relies is for example Gilsa, the sponsor for the security booth; considering that this company will be involved in the construction of the security booth and the project in general. This was realized by Mrs. Rosalina who contacted Mr. Sergio Anguiana, an employee at Gilsa, who committed to build the security booth as a donation by the company.</p><h3>Step 10. Evaluation and Reflection with the community</h3><p>To advise the community concerning our meeting, we decided to call them personally by phone. This was particularly helpful as we wanted to especially do this with the committee leaders and community representatives since they were the ones who did the most work. When we spoke with the President, Adolfo Siller, he informed us that there would be a meeting every Tuesday. It was still nevertheless important to speak with someone concerning any progress and change there has been in project, so there could no meeting especially dedicated to reflection. Nonetheless, the committee representatives were aware that in addition to continuing organizational matters, the project was be reflected upon on November Tuesday 12 at 8:00 PM.</p><p>We had planned to print out photos which we took in advance so that they would see the effect they\u2019ve had throughout the project. For example, in terms of the numbers of people who attended the meetings which gradually grew in size, photos of the security booth, the organization which they achieved in the creation of the committee by themselves, the sheet they made with telephone numbers so that they could communicate with each other, etc. Nonetheless, as the president told us that it would be necessary in order to advance the project, we were not able to do this due to the limited amount of time we had. It is important that they continue moving forward with their objectives, but this was still mentioned by him. We signaled that the advances that we had achieved, the organization that they were responsible for founding themselves, we congratulated them for their completed activities as they were their achievements and not ours. On the other hand, the president brought the car to the meeting which they were able to pay for. This was done so everyone could look at it and share their opinion on it. We also congratulated them due to the speed with which they were able to accomplish everything. We did not think it could be completed this quickly.</p><p>So that they could participate and reflect, we asked them how they felt about the project and its achievements. The mentioned that they noticed, like we did, the progress that they had had, especially considering everything was so disorganized at the beginning but slowly, in accordance with pressure, they went along organizing and formalizing their activities. They also mentioned that they were proud of having overcome any obstacles and conflicts which they came across throughout the project. They additionally said that they learned to work as a team, that\u2019s to say, to relate to each other and to get to know each other since as the beginning everyone had one problem in common, security, and despite this they did not know each other, so they mentioned that was instrumental in uniting the community.</p><p>After completing this evaluation and reflection we told them that our semester was over and that our project had come to its conclusion, that they showed that they could move forward alone, that they know what to do and we hope that they continue to work and grow as they have already done. The representatives of the committee gave us their thanks for our help, they asked us if we were going to continue to visit and we told them that if they ever needed anything we would be there to provide our help. They then continued with their meeting and we were sharing our opinion concerning their progress and then we finally bid farewell, we gave them our thanks and we told them to continue on with their project until they achieve their objectives.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The truth is that we are very proud of our job, at the beginning of the semester as we spoke about matters concerning the PAC we did not believe that this was achievable and even be close to achieving the project\u2019s objectives. Seeing the different achievements, the way in which the community moved and the way in which it is motivated makes us certain that the community will continue realizing activities in order to better itself, and they will no longer complain about some problem, but seek a way to resolve it. The formalization process which the community underwent as well as the project will make sure that this will extend much longer than the semester we spent there.</p><p>The PAC left us with a distinct lesson for each member of the team and everyone reflected on this matter.\u00a0</p>", "title": "The \u201cLas Brisas\u201d Participatory Project "}

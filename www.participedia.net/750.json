{"htmlbody": "<h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the primary purposes of the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation was to involve a diversity of people so that the renewal of outdoor recreation within the state would reflect and benefit all people. This deliberation did not only concern the usual bikers, hikers, fishermen, etc. but especially aimed to include the less frequent users of New Hampshire\u2019s outdoor recreation facilities. The New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development (DRED) and the New Hampshire Office of Energy and Planning (OEP) wanted to hear from citizens of all ages, communities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. As stated in the final report of the <em>Statewide Community Conversations on Outdoor Recreation in New Hampshire</em>,\"the goal of these community conversations was to create an opportunity for citizens to share their thoughts on the challenges, opportunities, issues, and needs relating to local and state outdoor recreation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation was organized by the NH Listens initiative of the University of New Hampshire\u2019s Carsey Institute, \u00a0with the New Hampshire Department of Resources and Economic Development (DRED), and the state Office of Energy and Planning (OEP). The New Hampshire Public Conversations focused on small group facilitated deliberation. It served as an entity of the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP), designed to improve the quality of outdoor recreation and parks. The SCORP follows the guidelines of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which require each state to have an approved SCORP on file with the National Park Service (NPS). The SCORP must be reviewed every five years, and completely updated and presented to the National Park Service every ten years. Since 2013 marks the end of the SCORP\u2019s ten-year term, the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation was held in 2011 in order to increase the efficiency of citizen input for the creation of the next SCORP. The people behind this civic engagement project included the Director, Bruce Mallory, the Project Manager, Michele Holt-Shannon, the Project Coordinator, Molly Donovan, and the Project Assistant, Julie Tracy.\u00a0</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation is part of NH Listens, a civic engagement initiative of the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 NH Listens recruited distinct groups of people through a database of local recreation departments, high schools, regional planning commissions, senior centers, health agencies, disability groups, and those working with new immigrant groups. In an effort to include a diversity of views for the upcoming SCORP, NH Listens used the database to pursue citizens that were less likely to join public deliberations on outdoor recreation, such as clients or constituents working with the elderly, youth, new immigrant groups, the physically disabled, and those working to connect health, obesity, and recreation. Such contacts were sent information on the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation and were offered easy access to registration. Furthermore, members of NH Listens worked to gain participants by personally contacting the target groups from the database as well as the rest of the public. There was also extensive coverage on the event in newspapers, newsletters, and online sources throughout New Hampshire.The participants of the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation registered online or over the telephone, though staff members of NH Listens did allow walk in participants. During registration, the interested citizens were asked questions, however they did not have to answer all of them. NH Listens surpassed their goal of 120 participants, as the total amount of registrants reached 171.</p><p>Below are some statistics about the participants found in the final report:</p><ul><li>Of those who pre-registered and filled out the registration\u00a0questions, 105 were female and 60 were male</li><li><p>Of those who reported their age, 69% of\u00a0registrants were between 45 and 65 years old;\u00a0</p></li><li><p>16% were between 31 and 44 years old;\u00a0</p></li><li><p>11% were over 65 years old</p></li><li><p>4% were under 30 years old</p></li></ul><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A survey showed that 152 participants claimed they use outdoor recreation facilities, while 4 said they do not. Of those respondents, 11 said they use outdoor recreation facilities daily, 50 said weekly, 32 participants answered monthly, and 56 claimed that they use outdoor facilities several times per year.</p><h3>Deliberation,\u00a0Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Based on the mission of NH Listens, the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation was created for quality civic engagement rather than partisan based arguments. This promoted productive deliberation through both expression and understanding of each person\u2019s unique perspectives. In the final report of the <em>Statewide Community Conversations on Outdoor Recreation in New Hampshire</em>, \u201cit is significant that our overall summary of input contains both issues of overlapping concern and issues of unique differences.\u201d In order to accomplish an accurate view of each group, the facilitator guided the participants through a four-stage process:</p><p>1. Introductions and personal stories about how participants relate to the focus topic of the dialogue (including their prior experiences with and opinions about the topic)</p><p>2. Review of the available data on the topic to assure common, comparable levels of\u00a0knowledge among the participants</p><p>3. Analysis of the topic and its multiple dimensions, leading to selection by the group of a small number of key issues (3-4) that are seen as most important for discussion\u00a0</p><p>4. In-depth discussion of the selected key issues and articulation of a final set of views, values, or recommended actions directed at relevant decision-makers</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The facilitator analyzed all views and opinions throughout the conversation, and then worked with the group to reach a final agreement. However, if there were multiple groups involved with the deliberation, the members NH Listens analyzed the statements from each group, identified the most common themes among all the groups, and agreed on an accurate, collective reflection of the views of all the different groups.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to the specific format for the New Hampshire Conversations on Outdoor Recreation, the OEP, DRED, and NH Listens created focus questions for the participants. According to the final report, \"these questions were used as the basis for developing the framwork for the community conversations.\" Broad focus questions included:</p><p>1. <em>How can our outdoor recreation areas become the best places for everyone to experience the natural wonders of New Hampshire?</em></p><p>2. <em>What improvements would you like to see in local and state outdoor recreation areas?</em></p><p>3. <em>How can state and local outdoor recreation areas help all of us, young and old, natives and newcomers, be healthy and fit?</em></p><p>4.\u00a0<em>Who should pay to keep outdoor recreation areas open and functioning? Are you willing and able to pay more for the use of state parks and recreation facilities?</em></p><p>Click <a href=\"https://www.nhstateparks.org/uploads/pdf/NH-SCORP_2013-2018_Appendix-A.pdf\">here </a>for the final report which details the in-depth inquiries posed under these four broader questions.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation entailed small group discussions that took place throughout the state; Berlin, Conway, Portsmouth, Lebanon, Manchester, Keene, and Laconia. There were 9-12 participants per group along with a professional facilitator. Each discussion lasted about three and half hours, and followed a five-step sequence:</p><ol><li><em>Introductions and Initial Concerns and Questions</em><ul><li>The beginning phase allowed the participants to socialize, establish some mutual ground, and determine common concerns regarding the topic at hand. According to the final report of the <em>Statewide Community Conversations on Outdoor Recreation in New Hampshire </em>\u201cit is important to give time to understanding how participants are personally connected to the topic.\u201d</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li value=\"2\"><em>I</em><em>nformation and Data Analysis</em><ul><li>At this time the participants were provided with data on outdoor recreation and parks in New Hampshire so that they were able to assess their personal observations and feelings on the topic information. \u00a0</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li value=\"3\"><em>Key Issues and Priorities</em><ul><li>After sharing their personal responses, the participants discussed and came up with a list of key issues and priorities to focus on throughout the deliberation.

Furthermore, the participants mentioned the value of solitude of just being outside, as well as the social qualities of outdoor recreation. They also expressed a commitment to the preservation of natural areas, especially for the enjoyment of future generations. The issue of future generations and their relationship with nature was a recurring theme throughout all of the group discussions. Most participants were extremely concerned with youth losing interest and connections with outdoor recreation and nature overall. While respondents from the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation voiced appreciation for New Hampshire\u2019s natural beauty, they feared that future generations would not care for environmental concerns.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Through discussion, the participants of the New Hampshire Public Conversations on Outdoor Recreation established, the key issues and priorities of the deliberation.

{"htmlbody": "<p class=\"documentFirstHeading\">As part of NESTA\u2019s national Your Local Budget pilot and the HACT up2us project, Norfolk County Council has supported a participatory budgeting exercise with 20 older people that attend a day centre in Kings Lynn. Many of them are deaf or visually impaired and some suffer from symptoms of dementia. The project explored participatory budgeting as a way of giving older people more choice and control over their day service activities, in preparation for managing their own personal budgets. They also wanted to gain some insight into how pooling personal budgets could work and how adaptable day centres were to future models of working.</p><p class=\"documentFirstHeading\">This case study was originally submitted to the Participatory Budgeting Unit in 2012 by the organisers of the project, using a template supplied by the PB Unit.</p><h3>Overview:</h3><p>We chose to run the pilot at the Crossroads day centre because we knew that staff were\u00a0committed to ensuring that the needs and desires of the older people were at the heart of\u00a0the service. Staff already provided a variety of different ways for users of the service to be\u00a0involved in shaping their experience at the centre. This included regularly meetings with\u00a0users of the service, an annual feedback questionnaire and individual assessments and\u00a0pathway plans.</p><p>Staff at the centre used the insight gathered through their various involvement\u00a0mechanisms to arrange activities for the older people. Unfortunately, some users of the\u00a0service struggled to make the link between their involvement and the activities offered at\u00a0the centre and they had little understanding of the costs. One user of the service\u00a0commented \u2018We haven\u2019t been able to choose what we wanted to do; it has always\u00a0been laid out for us.\u2019</p><p>The project has helped to encourage users of the service to move onto a personal budget\u00a0by generating discussion about the benefits and demystifying the process. It has also\u00a0helped the older people to develop an understanding of the true cost of the activities\u00a0provided at the centre. Several users of the service expressed that they felt the costs were\u00a0\u2018very reasonable\u2019 and one even suggested that some were \u2018undercharged\u2019.</p><p>The majority of the older people now have their own personal budget. This will support\u00a0Norfolk County Council to meet its target of having 30% of service users and carers\u00a0receiving community based services through a personal budget by September 2011.\u00a0The activity programme is still being implemented but the insight gained is already helping\u00a0to shape the future of day services in Norfolk. As we move towards the development of\u00a0community hubs, our participatory budgeting exercise is being used as an example of how\u00a0\u2018People become confident in expressing a preference for community based\u00a0activities when they are supported individually \u00a0and in groups with information and\u00a0advice.\u2019</p><p>We know that we have a better chance of meeting people\u2019s needs and providing services\u00a0that offer the best value for money when we involve users of our services in service design\u00a0and improvement. Our project has enabled the older people to personalise their\u00a0experience at the day centre. One user of the service commented \u2018I think it is a very\u00a0good idea. Rather then just getting told each week what we\u2019re going to do, we\u00a0choose what we want to do.\u2019 Senior staff also expressed how it has \u2018helped staff to\u00a0move to the next level\u2019 in their efforts to increase the choice and control that users of the\u00a0service have.</p><p>The project has supported staff with their negotiations with an external agency to secure a\u00a0consistent time slot for one user of the service to receive support to take a bath at the\u00a0centre. Staff were able to argue that as part of the pilot it was essential that the user of the\u00a0service had a consistent time so that it didn\u2019t clash with the activities she wanted to take\u00a0part in. This proved effective and the user of the service has expressed her joy at being\u00a0able to take part in her desired activities.</p><p>Devolving the funding and providing each user of the service with an individual activities\u00a0budget has helped to transfer power from the staff to the older people. It has inspired a\u00a0change in culture where users of the service no longer feel like passive consumers but\u00a0instead are active and empowered to direct their day service activities. An example of this\u00a0is a recent cake baking activity. Usually a communal joint-effort cake would be made and\u00a0eaten during afternoon tea. However, the users of the service, who had \u2018purchased\u2019 the\u00a0activity, asked staff if this could be changed so that they could each bake their favourite\u00a0cakes and take them home. Staff were initially thrown by this request, particularly because\u00a0of the short notice, but following encouragement and support, they embraced the\u00a0opportunity to deliver the activity in a new way.</p><p>The project has provided a valuable learning experience for the older people, day centre\u00a0staff, consultation and involvement offices and senior managers. One member of staff from\u00a0the day centre commented \u2018It has caused a lot of debate around choice and the way\u00a0we organise to</p><h3>Organisation:</h3>Norfolk County Council <h3>How:</h3><p>We sought to address this by working with the staff and devolving a budget to the older\u00a0people. We modelled the personal budgets process loosely and provided each person with\u00a0\u00a350 to spend on activities.\u00a0We helped broaden the older people\u2019s expectations by encouraging them to suggest and\u00a0consider a wide selection of activities that could take place at the centre and within the\u00a0wider community. This helped ensure that they had the opportunity to try new things and to\u00a0challenge themselves.</p><p>We worked with the staff to research activity providers and costs and developed an activity\u00a0brochure featuring a range of activities including beauty treatments, a murder mystery and\u00a0a trip to the English Whisky distillery.</p><p>We supported the older people to manage their budget and to develop a programme of\u00a0activities that they wished to be involved in. We worked with the staff to help them plan\u00a0and implement the activities programme and presented this to the older people on a\u00a0monthly basis. One user of the service identified that the activity programme has allowed\u00a0her to \u2018look forward\u2019 to activities as she knows in \u2018advance\u2019 what she is going to be doing.</p><h3>What:</h3><p>The project has supported staff with their negotiations with an external agency to secure a\u00a0consistent time slot for one user of the service to receive support to take a bath at the\u00a0centre.

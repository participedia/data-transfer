{"htmlbody": "<p>The Harrow Open Budget initiative was initiated by key officials in the London Borough of Harrow to open up the process of developing the 2006/7 Council budget.The local authority used a form of Participatory Budgeting whereby elements of the budget were opened up to public debate around local priorities. The mechanisms used to engage the public were a day long Open Assembly of local residents, together with an on going Panel of residents to monitor the process. The process was inspired by the findings of the recently completed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Inquiry\">Power Inquiry,</a> which made a wide number of recommendations for stimulating democracy in the UK.<br/><br/>The Open Assembly agreed to a list of budget priorities and the Panel, a smaller group of residents, ensured that implementation of the budget was monitored and that there was some accountability to the participants of the Assembly. The Open Budget was initiated at a time when there had been a lot of public consultation that had not been successful in reaching large numbers of residents.</p>This case study was originally submitted to the Participatory Budgeting Unit by the organisers of the project, using a template supplied by the PB Unit.<h3>Organisation:</h3>London Borough of Harrow <h3>Aims:</h3><ul><li>To rebuild public confidence in the local council decision making.</li><li>To engage the most vociferous and dissatisfied elements of the community in considered deliberations.</li><li>To provide a popular sense of ownership of the final budget priorities.</li><li>To help residents understand the issues facing officers.</li><li>To help elected officers understand the concerns of residents.</li><li>To offer opportunities to engage the local media</li><li>To rebuild democratic engagement and dialogue.</li><li>To take community engagement seriously</li><li>To increase the profile and importance of local Councillors by allowing them to engage in dialogue with Harrow residents about decisions facing the local authority.</li></ul><h3>Where:</h3><p>London Borough of Harrow</p><h3>How:</h3><p>Over 300 Harrow residents attended an open assembly in October 2003 to discuss and vote on key priorities across the council\u2019s budget.

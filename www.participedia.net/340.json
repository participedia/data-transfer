Initiatives and referenda, used this way, can be a force for good public policy and spur increases in voter turnout by those who are too often ignored by the broader electoral establishment.</p><p>The qualification process varies in each of the 24 initiative states and based on the type of initiative. Learn more about the types of initiatives or how to qualify. Also, find out which states currently have popular referenda.</p>", "title": "Ballot Initiative Strategy Center"}

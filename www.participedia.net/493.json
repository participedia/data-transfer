It begins with community organising and is followed by facilitated, small group dialogue that leads to change. Study circles don\u2019t advocate a particular solution. Instead, they welcome many points of view around a shared concern.</p><p>In a Dialogue to Change program, a number of small, diverse group of 5 to 8 participants (a \u2018study circle\u2019) meet for 2 hours weekly for 4 weeks (a \u2019round of study circles\u2019), to address a critical public issue in a democratic and collaborative way. Led by a neutral facilitator, people consider an issue from many points of view while the discussion progresses from personal experiences, to sessions that examine many views on the issue, to a session that considers strategies for action and change.</p><p>The round of study circles is followed by a facilitated Action Forum \u2013 a community event designed to tie together the work of the individual study circles, and help participants move to individual and collective action. At the forum, groups can share their ideas for action, and participants can join or create action efforts.</p><p>ASCN and the D2C program adhere to the internationally recognised and endorsed Seven Core Principles of dialogue and deliberation:</p><ul><li>Careful Planning and Preparation</li><li>Inclusion and Democratic Diversity</li><li>Collaboration and Shared Purpose</li><li>Openess and Learning</li><li>Transparency and Trust</li><li>Impact and Action</li><li>Sustained Engagement and Participatory Culture</li></ul><h2>Major projects</h2><p>Maryborough Dialogue to Change Program (Victoria, Australia)</p><p>Video - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIuQFxBChaE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIuQFxBChaE</a></p><p>Program Report - <a href=\"http://studycircles.net.au/Content/2011/06/maryborough-d2c-program-report/\">http://studycircles.net.au/Content/2011/06/maryborough-d2c-program-report/</a></p><h2>\u00a0</h2><p>\u00a0</p><h3>\u00a0</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Australian Study Circles Network "}

{"htmlbody": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.c2d2.ca/\">Canadian Community for Dialogue and Deliberation (C2D2) website</a>, the organization's mission is \"to increase our society\u2019s capacity to have constructive conversations to enhance decision- making and collaborative action, to improve relationships and generate insight and knowledge \u2013 in short, to strengthen democracy\".</p><p>The purpose behind creating C2D2 was to strengthen communities through dialogue and deliberation (D&amp;D). The organization has effectively done so by hosting popular events and conferences throughout Canada. Those working and volunteering at C2D2 all agree participatory government through D&amp;D is very important to the success of a community or nation. By continually striving for these positive changes, C2D2 has been able to recruit hundreds of supporters nationwide.</p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Co-founders Miriam Wyman and Sandra Zagon attended the 2002 National Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD). They immediately realized the beneficial need for such organizations and conferences in Canada. Three years later, October 2005, employees at C2D2 helped host the first Canadian Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation. Wyman and Zagon's vision had come true; more than 300 people deliberately participated. The conference was deemed successful because it laid a thriving foundation for which the C2D2 was founded upon. Although the organization was officially founded in 2006, C2D2 had already created a positive impact on the nation.</p><p>Today, the organization is responsible for a nationwide conference every other year in Canada. In between conferences, employees and volunteers strive to promote strong deliberative processes throughout Canadian communities.</p><p><a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>Every two years, the Canadian Community for Dialogue and Deliberation invites citizens and professionals to a deliberative conference.</p><ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.c2d2.ca/conference2005/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.c2d2.ca/conference2005/\">Ottawa, 2005</a>; The theme surrounding Ottawa's conference was, \"From Dream to Reality\".

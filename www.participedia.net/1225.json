{"htmlbody": "<p class=\"documentDescription\">Buckinghamshire County Council have taken a different approach to PB. Rather than trial a small grants pot, as most would when starting out with PB, Buckinghamshire are going to pilot 4 different kinds of PB at once. Buckinghamshire is aiming to integrate PB as 'the way we do community engagement'. </p>This case study was originally submitted to the Participatory Budgeting Unit by the organisers of the project, using a template supplied by the PB Unit.<h3>Overview:</h3><p>Buckinghamshire County Council are working with district councils in all parts of the county to pilot different models of participatory budgeting around the county.\u00a0 The aim is to integrate PB as a way of life in Buckinghamshire.\u00a0 They have recently gained the approval of the Executive and are looking to begin implementation in the Autumn.\u00a0 The areas they are looking at using PB in are:</p><ul><li>Young people \u2013 Youth Opportunities Fund and Positive Activities for Young People</li><li>Devolved budgets to wards</li><li>Transportation: \u00a3500K to each of 19 local community areas</li><li>Broad priorities for Council budget \u2013 focus on health inequalities with Primary Care Trust</li><li>Local Area Agreement Safer and Stronger Communities block in partnership with the police</li></ul><h3>Organisation:</h3>Buckinghamshire County Council \u00a0Original Source: <a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/case-studies/case-studies/an-integrated-approach-to-pb-in-buckinghamshire\">http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/case-studies/case-studies/an-integrated-approach-to-pb-in-buckinghamshire</a> accessed 2/8/2013.\u00a0<p><strong>The following information was adapted from the website of Buckinghamshire County Council: </strong><a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/community/participatory-budgeting#.UfuQtKyYfVU\">http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/community/participatory-budgeting#.UfuQtKyYfVU</a> accessed 2.8.2013</p><p>The image associated with this caseis of students at Mandeville School participated in the voting.</p><p>Participatory budgeting enables residents to have a say in how public money is spent, not just by suggesting ideas as with a consultation but in the allocation of a specific budget.\u00a0</p><p>In Buckinghamshire, some Local Area Forums (LAFs) have been using participatory budgeting as a means of enabling residents to get involved in spending LAF budgets to meet local priorities.</p><p>In 2012, two LAFs ran participatory budgeting projects in Greater Aylesbury, an area encompassing Aylesbury and eight other rural and urban parishes, and also Wendover which included five neighbouring parishes. Around 2,350 residents voted in Greater Aylesbury and 600 local people voted in Wendover local area.</p><p>Both projects actively sought to engage with all sectors of the community, including young people\u00a0- in particular those aged 11 and above.</p><p>Residents were given a variety of opportunities to participate, by voting online or by paper voting in ballot boxes which were placed in locations including shops, pubs, health centres, community centres and other community facilities.</p><p>Voting also took place at market stall events held to encourage resident participation, family fun days, activities for young people and at a school-wide project. We didn\u2019t just wait for residents to vote, but went out to actively seek local involvement.</p><p>A key part of the projects\u2019 success was the involvement of partner agencies, community groups, local businesses, local media and community facilities, who were willing to promote, actively help and get the word out about each project.</p><p>For more detailed information on the work undertaken to develop and run the two participatory projects, including voting numbers and project outcomes:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/132524/greater-ayles-outcome.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Choose 4 Greater Aylesbury</a> (pdf)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/132696/wendover-decides-outcome.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Wendover Decides 2012</a>\u00a0(pdf)</li></ul><p>Videos were produced on the Choose 4 Greater Aylesbury participatory budgeting project which ran during 2012:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCE4w-PrGT0&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Greater Aylesbury community forum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=BtsrO80Nst4\">Wendover decides</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KrklKx0gUY\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mandeville School participatory budgeting project\">Mandeville School participatory budgeting project</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTqEi-tC4Rs\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Choose 4 Greater Aylesbury market stall event\">Choose 4 Greater Aylesbury market stall event</a></li></ul>The following information was taken from \"<a href=\"http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/132524/greater-ayles-outcome.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Choose 4 Greater Aylesbury</a>\"<p data-canvas-width=\"35.80930278706597\" data-font-name=\"g_font_p0_1\" dir=\"ltr\">Voting was open to all residents in the Greater Aylesbury area, either online at: <a href=\"http://www.choose4greateraylesbury.com\">www.choose4greateraylesbury.com</a> or via paper voting in ballot boxes throughout the area.</p><p data-canvas-width=\"114.8438936584183\" data-font-name=\"g_font_p0_1\" dir=\"ltr\">Voting was undertaken by ranking the top four project choices from 1\u20145 (with 1 being the highest).

{"htmlbody": "<h3><strong>Problems and Purpose</strong></h3><p>\u201cImagine Philadelphia\u201d was a project that involved citizens in the process of creating a new city plan for Philadelphia. The role of participatory democracy in the city planning process had had three basic purposes. The first was to assemble data and background information needed for preparing a long-range comprehensive plan for the city. The second purpose was to engage regional experts and citizens in dialogue about the future of neighborhoods, the city, and the region. The third and final purpose was to lay out preliminary ideas about vision, goals, and actions to inform a subsequent, citywide comprehensive-planning effort.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, is considered to be the nation\u2019s birthplace. In the 1600s textiles, printing, and papermaking were among Philadelphia\u2019s major industries. Because of this, Philadelphia became a cultural melting pot and even the financial center of the country. In the 1700s Independence Hall, one of the most famous and historical buildings in Philadelphia, was built. On July 4, 1776, the Unites States Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia. From 1790-1800 Philadelphia was the capital of the Unites States. Unfortunately, the city deteriorated over the 20h century. Crime rates began to drastically increase, accompanied by rising gang and mafia-related violence. The city was portrayed as corrupt and the population began to decline.</p><p>In 2004, the Building Industry Association issued a report identifying ten issues impeding Philadelphia\u2019s growth and revitalization. One issue was the archaic, complex, and difficult-to-enforce zoning code. The unwieldiness of the zoning code resulted from Philadelphia\u2019s outdated Comprehensive Plan, which had been last updated in 1962. The Association\u2019s report suggested that Philadelphia create a new zoning code and city plan, and in May 2007, as part of new mayor Michael Nutter\u2019s goal of creating \u201cthe next great city\u201d, citizens passed a referendum to create a new Zoning Code Commission.\u00a0 The Zoning Code Commission was charged with identifying problems with Philadelphia\u2019s zoning code and creating a comprehensive new city plan.</p><p>According to the charter of the commission, \u201cthe comprehensive plan shall be known as the Physical Development Plan of the City and shall show the general location, character and extent of streets, parks, recreation facilities, sites for public buildings and structures, pier head and bulkhead lines, City and privately owned facility utility facilities, waterways, water conduits, and such other features as will provide for the improvement of the City and its future growth and development and afford adequate facilities for the housing, transportation, distribution, health and welfare of its population.\u201d (Section 4-600 Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, 1951)</p><p>According to the report on Imagine Philadelphia, there were three motivations for the timeliness of the initiative: a need for central rather than patchwork planning; the opportunity to prosper from predicted trends about energy, land use, and population growth and migration and the importance of a sustainable future; and the revision of the Zoning Code.</p><h3><strong>Originating Entities and Funding</strong></h3><p>Imagine Philadelphia was created and organized by the Philadelphia Zoning Code Commission.\u00a0 It was funded by grants from the Land Use Planning and Technical Assistance Program (Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development), the Transportation and Community Development Intiative (Delaware Valley of Regional Planning Commission), and the City of Philadephia.</p><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>Over 700 participants were involved in the process and it was widely received with positive media coverage. Participants included city planners, residents, workers, students, visitors, and other stakeholders.\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction\u00a0</strong></h3><p>The Imagine Philadelphia process started in 2007 with a series of eight roundtable meetings of regional experts focused on specific planning topics. The meetings were run by a consulting team led by FX Fowle of New York.</p><p>These were followed by nine widely publicized workshops in late 2007 and early 2008 which were open to the community. The sessions provided opportunity for broad input, with the intent on generating some \u201cbig ideas\u201d. The workshops were organized around eight topics, each of which was to be considered with regard to the future of Philadelphia over the next 25 years. The topics were: industrial land, housing and community development, preservation, mobility, economic development, open spaces, public facilities, and urban design. Each topic was broken into four parts: rationale and opportunities, challenges to reaching the goal, big transformative ideas, and short-term actions.</p><h3><strong>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></h3><p>Imagine Philadelphia resulted in the creation of 19 strategic district plans covering all parts of the city.\u00a0 All 19 strategic plans include a section covering each of the eight workshop topics.</p><p>Imagine Philadelphia revealed that citizens wanted:</p><ul><li>Arts and culture to be celebrated along with a vibrant Benjamin Franklin parkway and Avenue of the Arts, and also in neighborhood venues</li><li>The Philadelphia economy to be diversified and the city to be a global leader in green technology and niche industries</li><li>There should be a wide range of housing choices that are affordable and respond to changing household needs</li><li>Neighborhoods should be offered a wide array of services and amenities</li><li>Public open space and waterways should be accessible</li><li>There should be intergovernmental cooperation and a seamless transit system</li><li>There should be convenient and interconnected modes of transportation</li></ul><p>The City Planning Commission staff worked with consultants to develop the desires of citizens into more complete vision statements with specific goals. The results are included in the \u201cNotes\u201d section below.</p><p>The City Planning Commission continued to work on meaningful citizen participation as it moves forward with the long-range planning effort, now called Philadelphia2035. In winter 2010, the Commission created a Citizens Planning Institute. The Institute offers a series of free and low-cost courses and workshops about planning in order to \u201ceducate citizens about the role good planning and implementation play in helping to create communities of lasting value.\u201d Volunteer instructors from the public and private sectors and funding from the William Penn Foundation have enabled the Institute to keep course costs low and accessible to a diverse group of participants. As fo the fall of 2011, the Institute had certified 89 Citizen Planners from 60 different neighborhoods across the city.</p><p>The City Planning Commission is also attempting to engage citizens through new technology. The Philadelphia2035 website includes the plans for each district, general information about the planning and Healthy Communities initiatives, reports on recent events, advertisements of citizen engagement opportunities, and contacts for community planners in each district. The Philadelphia2035 Facebook page, with 1,162 followers as of July 2012, is regularly updated with news and invitations for citizens to participate in planning-related events. In the summer of 2012, the city experimented with <a href=\"http://phila2035.org/text-messaging-for-phila2035-community-feedback/#more-2144\">Textizen</a>, placing posters asking questions like \u201cHow do you mainly use city recreation sites?\u201d or \u201cWhat would make Central City more kid-friendly?\u201d across the city and providing a phone number to which citizens could text their responses.\u00a0</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h3><p>Some projects have already been completed but the city still has a lot more to accomplish before 2035. \u00a0</p><p>Citizens' comments have included: \u201cCongratulations on a great first step on a very long road\u201d and \u201cTruly a great way to give a voice and empowerment to the people. Please keep this up.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3><strong>External Links</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://citizensplanninginstitute.org/\">Citizens Planning Institute</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/CityOfPhiladelphia/imagine-philadelphia-laying-the-foundation\">Imagine Philadelphia: Laying the Foundation.

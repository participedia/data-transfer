{"htmlbody": "<p><a id=\"Definition\" name=\"Definition\"></a></p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Participatory budgeting is a decision-making process through which citizens deliberate and negotiate over the distribution of public resources.<a href=\"#cite_note-wampler-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>Participatory budgeting programs are implemented at the behest of governments, citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil society organizations (CSOs) to allow citizens to play a direct role in deciding how and where resources should be spent. These programs create opportunities for engaging, educating, and empowering citizens, which can foster a more vibrant civil society. Participatory budgeting also helps promote transparency, which has the potential to reduce government inefficiencies and corruption. Because most citizens who participate have low incomes and low levels of formal education, participatory budgeting offers citizens from historically excluded groups the opportunity to make choices that will affect how their government acts. Put simply, participatory budgeting programs provide poor and historically excluded citizens with access to important decision-making venues.<a href=\"#cite_note-wampler-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p><a id=\"Process\" name=\"Process\"></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p>The UK's Participatory Budgeting Unit reports that, as participatory budgeting is quite new, innovative forms of participatory budgeting are being developed all the time and new budgets, new themes, new partners, different areas are demonstrating that participatory budgeting is possible and beneficial for a wide range of services and areas.</p><p>The participatory budgeting process usually requires citizen engagement in the various phases of a budget cycle to identify the capital investments and projects to address the most pressing local needs.</p><p>Participatory budgeting involves citizens, councillors and local government officers working together. Participatory budgeting aims to include those who are not traditionally engaged in policy decisions. As well as citizen involvement, participatory budgeting creates opportunities for greater efficiency in the allocation of public funds and increased community cohesion.</p><p>The main features of participatory budgeting include:</p><ul><li>a geographically defined area such as a local authority, a decentralised district of a local authority, or a defined neighbourhood</li><li>regularly scheduled meetings and debates in each geographical unit</li><li>a cycle of activities closely following the local budgeting cycle</li><li>a network of individuals and organisations involved in training, informing and mobilising local citizen</li></ul><p>There is no universal way of applying participatory budgeting. Methodologies vary from area to area but typically it involves allocating between two to three percent of the annual revenue budgets and sometimes the allocation of new investments. The process involves citizens taking into account both the demand and supply of services and public infrastructure. In the UK, participatory budgeting has mainly been applied to allocating resources for area regeneration and for directing statutory funds to voluntary sector organisations.<a href=\"#cite_note-1\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p><a id=\"History\" name=\"History\"></a></p><h2>History</h2><p><a id=\"Genesis_in_Porto_Alegre\" name=\"Genesis_in_Porto_Alegre\"></a></p><h3>Genesis in Porto Alegre</h3><p>Participatory budgeting began in 1989 in the municipality of Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul (see <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/participatory-budgeting-porto-alegre\">Porto Alegre Participatory Budgeting</a>). Porto Alegre has more than 1 million inhabitants and is wealthy by Brazilian standards. In 1988 the Workers\u2019 Party, a progressive political party founded during the waning years of the 1964\u201385 military dictatorship, won the mayoral election. Its campaign was based on democratic participation and the \u201cinversion of spending priorities\u201d\u2014that is, the reversal of a decades-long trend in which public resources were spent in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. Participatory budgeting was intended to help poorer citizens and neighborhoods receive larger shares of public spending.</p><p>When the Workers\u2019 Party won the mayor\u2019s office in Porto Alegre, it inherited a bankrupt municipality and a disorganized bureaucracy. During its first two years in office, the new administration experimented with different mechanisms to tackle financial constraints, provide citizens with a direct role in the government\u2019s activities, and invert the social spending priorities of previous administrations. Participatory budgeting was born through this experimental process.</p><p>In 1989 and 1990, the first two years of participatory budgeting, fewer than 1,000 citizens participated in the participatory budgeting process; by 1992 the number of participants had jumped to nearly 8,000. After the Workers\u2019 Party was re-elected in 1992, the program took on a life of its own, with participation increasing to more than 20,000 people a year. Participation grew as citizens realized that participatory budgeting was an important decision-making venue.<a href=\"#cite_note-wampler-0\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p><a id=\"Experimentation_in_Latin_America\" name=\"Experimentation_in_Latin_America\"></a></p><h3>Experimentation in Latin America</h3><p>Throughout the 1990s, participatory budgeting spread to other municipalities in Brazil and to other countries in South America, including Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru.

The design factors were: how formal or informal the process was (ie was it reserved for formal associations to participate or could anyone join in?) and the level of decision-making power of the participants (ie whether the participants debate and decide on spending priorities, how much of the budget is affected by these decisions, and whether authorities respect the decisions). The success criteria were: participation rate, level of expansion/redistribution of services and transparency. Goldfrank concluded that there is \"some support for the assertion that outcomes tend to be better where participatory budgeting is less formalized and more deliberative...where the structures were less formal, participants had more decision-making power, participation rates were higher, policies were more redistributive, and government was more transparent.\"<a href=\"#cite_note-goldfrank-2\" title=\"\">[3]</a></p><p>The <a href=\"/organizations/european-institute-public-participation\" title=\"European Institute for Public Participation\">European Institute for Public Participation</a> is working with the <a href=\"/wiki/Participatory_Budgeting_Unit,_Manchester,_UK\" title=\"Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK\">Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK</a> and the UK Government's <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Department_for_Communities_and_Local_Government&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Department for Communities and Local Government (page does not exist)\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a> to develop a framework for the evaluation of participatory budgeting, along with other forms of public participation in the UK.</p><p><a id=\"References\" name=\"References\"></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-wampler-0\">\u2191 <a href=\"#cite_ref-wampler_0-0\" title=\"\">1.0</a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-wampler_0-1\" title=\"\">1.1</a> <a href=\"#cite_ref-wampler_0-2\" title=\"\">1.2</a> Wampler, Brian. 2007. \u2018A Guide to Participatory Budgeting\u2019. in Shah, Anwar (ed.).

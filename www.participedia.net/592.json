{"htmlbody": "<h3>Definition</h3><p>A Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review (CIR) is a <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury\">Citizens\u2019 Jury</a> that deliberates about a ballot <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/initiative-process\">initiative</a>. In a CIR, organizers select a panel, made up of a random sample of 18-24 citizens, who are demographically representative of the population. The panelists meet for five days to learn and deliberate about a ballot initiative\u2014a proposed law or constitutional amendment that is drafted by, and can be enacted by a direct vote of, citizens\u2014that will be voted on in an upcoming election.</p><p>During the CIR, the panelists hear arguments from advocates and stakeholders supporting and opposing the initiative, as well as neutral background witnesses\u2019 presentations about issues related to the initiative.\u00a0 Panelists have opportunities to question the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses. Then the panelists deliberate to identify important facts about the initiative, to decide whether to support or oppose the initiative, and to identify reasons to justify their support or opposition.\u00a0 The panelists\u2019 deliberations are structured and led by a moderator, who ensures that each panelist\u2019s voice and opinion are heard and considered.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of the CIR, the panelists write a Citizens\u2019 Statement that sets out the facts about the initiative that they agree on, the number of panelists supporting and opposing the initiative, and the panelists\u2019 reasons for supporting and opposing the initiative. The Citizens\u2019 Statement is then made available to the public and the media. In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of Oregon, the Citizens\u2019 Statement is included in the official voters\u2019 guide, a booklet, published by the government, that gives citizens information about candidates and ballot measures to be voted on in an election.\u00a0 A CIR thus lets voters hear from well-informed citizens who help voters make the best choice regarding an initiative.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The key problem the CIR seeks to address is that voters often receive inadequate information about ballot initiatives. Surveys show that many voters are unaware of ballot initiatives before election day. In addition, surveys show that many voters have inaccurate knowledge of ballot initiatives and few voters can express reasons to support or oppose particular ballot initiatives. Further, long-term public policy problems arising from ballot initiatives and the high rate at which ballot initiatives are struck down by courts indicate that many voters lack sufficient information about the policy consequences and the legality of ballot initiatives. The purpose of the CIR is to remedy these problems by improving the quality of information voters receive about ballot initiatives.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>In 1999 in the U.S. state of Washington Michael Lowry, former governor of the state, proposed applying the Citizens\u2019 Jury process to Washington State ballot initiatives; this new process was called Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review.\u00a0</p><p>From 1999-2007, Ned Crosby, founder of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/jefferson-center\">the Jefferson Center</a>, which developed the Citizens\u2019 Jury, and his wife Patricia Benn developed and promoted the CIR process in Washington State, but the CIR was not incorporated into Washington State\u2019s official initiative process.</p><p>In 2000 John Gastil, in his book <em>By Popular Demand: Revitalizing Representative Democracy Through Deliberative Elections</em>, recommended that the Citizens\u2019 Jury be applied to initiatives and referenda.</p><p>As early as 2002 a Website for the Washington Citizens' Initiative Review was \u00a0established at the URL: cirwa.org. \u00a0(For archived versions of that Website, <a href=\"http://wayback.archive.org/web/20020515000000*/http://www.cirwa.org\">click here</a>).</p><p>In 2003 Gastil and Crosby wrote an <a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Voters-need-more-reliable-information-1128957.php\">op-ed article</a> reporting survey results showing that Washington State citizens had little knowledge of the initiatives on the 2003 Washington State ballot, and citing these results as evidence of the need for a CIR.</p><p>According to Tyrone Reitman, Crosby and Benn also advocated for the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon in 2003.</p><p>In 2005 Crosby and others founded a nonprofit organization called <a href=\"http://promotinghealthydemocracy.org/\">Promoting Healthy Democracy</a> (PHD), which began supporting CIR projects in 2009.</p><p>In 2006, Tyrone Reitman and Elliot Shuford organized a project to introduce the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon. Crosby and Benn agreed to fund the project.\u00a0 In early 2007 Reitman and Shuford founded <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/healthy-democracy-oregon\">Healthy Democracy Oregon</a> (HDO), an organization that would carry out the project, which was called the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir\">Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review</a> (Oregon CIR). After a successful trial in 2008 the Oregon Legislature authorized the Oregon CIR for the 2010 election. In 2010 two Oregon CIRs were held and produced two Citizens\u2019 Statements, which were included in the official 2010 Oregon voters\u2019 guide. \u00a0In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon\u2019s statewide initiative process.</p><p>In 2011 HDO created a new, related organization, <a href=\"http://healthydemocracyfund.org/\">Healthy Democracy Fund</a> (HDF). HDF\u2019s activities include raising funds to sustain the Oregon CIR, further developing the CIR process, and applying the CIR method to public policy issues in legislatures in a process called Citizens\u2019 Policy Review.</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h3><p>Once the CIR organizers have chosen the panel, advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, the organizers gather the panel and explain the panel\u2019s charge. The panel\u2019s charge is to write a Citizens\u2019 Statement explaining key facts about the initiative that a majority of the panel agrees about, stating how many panelists support or oppose the initiative, and setting out the reasons that the panelists support or oppose the initiative. The charge acts as a guideline for the panel, the advocates, the stakeholders, and the background witnesses.</p><p>On the first day of the CIR the panelists learn about the CIR procedures, practice deliberating according to the CIR procedures while using a hypothetical initiative, receive a brief overview of the actual initiative that will be the subject of their deliberations, and get to know each other. The next three days are dedicated to hearings at which advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses present arguments and information to the panel. There is time allotted for the panelists to ask question of the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, and also time for the panelists to deliberate. \u00a0Trained moderators organize the questioning and deliberations to ensure that all advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses are treated fairly and that all panelists have the opportunity to be heard.\u00a0</p><p>After the hearings have been completed the panelists engage in final deliberations about the initiative. These deliberations are also moderated. \u00a0During these deliberations the panelists decide on key facts about the initiative that a majority of panelists agree on, determine whether they support or oppose the initiative, and choose the best arguments supporting or opposing the initiative. Once these decisions have been made the panelists write a Citizens\u2019 Statement that sets out those key facts, the number of panelists supporting or opposing the initiative, and their reasons for supporting or opposing the initiative.</p><p>On the final day of the CIR there is a public event at which the panelists present their Citizens\u2019 Statement. In some jurisdictions the Citizens\u2019 Statement is included in the official voters\u2019 guide that explains ballot initiatives to voters.\u00a0</p><p>An important part of the CIR process is the panelists\u2019 evaluation of the CIR process. The panelists are asked to evaluate the process itself and the CIR personnel who moderate and organize the CIR. The panelists use several criteria to evaluate the CIR including the quality of the deliberations and any bias in the process or exhibited by CIR personnel. \u00a0As part of the evaluation each panelist may write a personal statement in which he or she may express views that were not included in the Citizens\u2019 Statement.</p><p>Some time after the CIR has concluded the CIR organizers publish a final report about the CIR. The final report includes the Citizens\u2019 Statement, the panelists\u2019 evaluations of the CIR, and descriptions of the CIR process.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>In 2008 HDO conducted a successful field test using the CIR process. \u00a0In 2009 the Oregon Legislature approved a trial of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review (Oregon CIR) to be held the following year. In 2010 HDO organized two Oregon CIRs, in each of which a randomly selected sample of 24 Oregon citizens learned and deliberated for five days about an initiative that was to appear on the November 2010 Oregon statewide ballot.</p><p>The first 2010 Oregon CIR, held August 9-13, 2010, concerned Measure 73, a proposed statute that would impose mandatory minimum criminal sentences for certain repeat offenses concerning driving while intoxicated, and for certain sexual offenses.

Those Citizens\u2019 Statements were printed in the official 2010 Oregon Voters\u2019 Pamphlet.</p><p>John Gastil, Katherine Knobloch, and colleagues conducted a study of the 2010 Oregon CIRs. The key results of the study were:</p><ul><li>The Oregon CIR panelists had engaged in deliberations of good quality, including consistently \"fair and respectful discussions\";</li><li>The Oregon CIR Citizens\u2019 Statements accurately reflected their deliberations, contained no substantial factual or logical errors, and contained new and useful information for voters;</li><li>Surveys of Oregon voters showed that (1) most Oregon voters were unaware of the Oregon CIRs; (2) 65% of Oregon voters read the Citizens\u2019 Statement concerning Measure 73 and 57% read the Citizens\u2019 Statement on Measure 74; (3) for those voters who read the Citizens' Statements, reading the Citizens' Statements significantly increased voters' knowledge of and reduced voters' support for Measures 73 and 74; (4) the effect of reading the Citizens' Statements on voters' opposition to the ballot initiatives was too small to have influenced the outcome of the 2010 Oregon statewide election, but was large enough to indicate that in a future close ballot initiative election, a Citizens' Statement could potentially influence the outcome.</li></ul><p>For detailed results of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73\">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 73</a>, <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73\">click here</a>.</p><p>For detailed results of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74\">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 74</a>, <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74\">click here</a>.</p><p>In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making the Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon\u2019s statewide initiative process.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Gastil and Knobloch's study of the 2010 Oregon CIR concluded that the CIR design used during the 2010 Oregon CIRs had been generally \"appropriate and effective.\" In their 2010 report and in subsequent papers they also recommended several modifications to the CIR process:</p><ul><li>To enhance the stability and the knowledge base of a CIR, a CIR in a particular jurisdiction should be governed by a permanent board, whose members should include CIR organizers and moderators, public officials from the jurisdiction, and former CIR panelists.</li><li>If possible, CIR organizers should try to hold CIRs on every ballot initiative to appear on a ballot, and to schedule CIRs well in advance to allow advocates, stakeholders, and expert witnesses ample time to prepare their presentations.</li><li>CIR organizers should offer advocates training concerning how to make effective presentations to a CIR panel, because advocates are likely to be unfamiliar with the procedures and time constraints of the CIR.</li><li>If fewer than all initiatives to appear on a ballot can be addressed by CIRs, when choosing which ballot initiatives to review, CIR organizers should use particular selection criteria, such as the fiscal or legal impact of the initiative, the complexity of the issue, and the extent of voters\u2019 uncertainty about the issue. Using such selection criteria will ensure that CIRs address ballot initiatives about which voters most need information.</li><li>The voting requirement for including a key factual finding in a Citizens\u2019 Statement should be raised from 14 to 18, to ensure that included findings have broad support among panelists.</li><li>Citizens\u2019 Statements should address general concerns and include value-based arguments, so as to be more accessible and relevant to voters.</li><li>CIR organizers should assure panelists that unanimous support for or opposition to a ballot initiative is an acceptable outcome of the CIR. This assurance should prevent panelists from taking a position that is contrary to their views, merely in order to avoid a unanimous outcome.</li><li>CIR organizers should give panelists sufficient time to deliberate about their reasons for approving and opposing the initiative, especially when one side has relatively little support, because such deliberation improves the quality of those reasons.</li></ul><p>The Social Capital Review published an article, by DeAnna Martin, about the Oregon CIR. The article summarized the Oregon CIR process in a positive light. The article compared the Oregon CIR's participant-selection procedure to the Jury Process, and saw the Oregon CIR as a beneficial addition to Oregon\u2019s democracy.</p><p>Some criticisms of the Oregon CIR have been expressed by proponents of Measure 73. These advocates argued that the Oregon CIR process was flawed on the grounds that the Oregon CIR sampling procedure was not stratified on the basis of support for or opposition to the measures; that advocates were not allowed to cross-examine other advocates, stakeholders, or background witnesses; and that advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses were not required to testify under oath.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Binder, M., Boudreau, C., &amp; Kousser, T.

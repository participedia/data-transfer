It was originally submitted by </em>Francesco Molinari<em>.</em></p><p>Participa en Andaluc\u00eda is an e-Democracy platform promoted by the Regional Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise of Andalusia and managed by the Fernando de los R\u00edos Consortium since May 2008. It acts as an intermediary between Andalusian towns and citizens by promoting participation in public decision making on specific issues and action items that can be discussed and voted upon by the registered users on the platform. It allows presenting and discussing policy proposals to the Municipal Governments associated to the platform, some of them have become actual initiatives.</p><h2>Project Description</h2><h3>Problem and Objective</h3><p>The general issue this platfrom aims to tackle with is the growing distance between citizens and governments in modern democratic societies. An additional mattern of concern is to allow small Municipalities with low budget shares dedicated to ICT the means to fully grasp the potential benefits of electronic participation.</p><h3>Structure and Process</h3><p>The Regional Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise runs the platform in collaboration with the Fernando de los Rios Consortium. The Andalusian Municipalities can join the initiative by committing themselves to an online presence on the plafrom with their own representatives and to make an assessment of all the proposals received. Registered users (citizens, associations or political parties) can select the Municipality they want to submit a proposal to, then launch their proposals by posting on the blog and opening a discussion on them. The other users can visualise existing proposals (if anonymous) and also send comment and cast votes on them (if they are registered). The Municipality representatives can grade the proposals according to their feasibility and compliance with the rules of participation. Some of them can actually be implemented as real policy actions.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>A growing number of Andalusian Municipalities - now more than one third - and citiens - now several thousands - has joined the platform. Quite a few hundreds of proposals have been raised on the platform and some of them actually realised.</p><h3>Detailed Information</h3><h4>Broader Context</h4><p>It is a project in e-Democracy within the framework of the \u201ccitizens participation\u201d strategic line of the Andalusian Plan for Modernisation, Innovation and the Development of the Information Society, run by the Regional Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise.</p><h4>Type of Contribution by Participants</h4><p>They determined the outcomes of the project</p><h4>Target Group</h4><p>The Andalusian Municipalities, citizens, associations and political parties.</p><h4>Total Number of People Addressed by the Project (approx.)</h4><p>1,000,000</p><h4>Total Number of Active Participants (approx.)</h4><p>2,000</p><h4>Specific Effort Made to Include Disadvantaged Groups</h4><p>Extensive effort to address disadvantaged groups</p><p>Socially excluded groups: The aim is to extend the use of information and communication technologies to people who lack access for social, cultural or financial reasons.

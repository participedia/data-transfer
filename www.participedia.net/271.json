{"htmlbody": "<p><a id=\"Mission_and_Purpose\" name=\"Mission_and_Purpose\"></a></p><h2>Mission and Purpose</h2><p>Involving People has been set up to support and encourage patient, service user and carer involvement in health and social care research in Wales.</p><p>Through processes of active involvement, where people are not just the subjects of research but are working with researchers to plan, manage, carry out and present research. This could mean checking patient leaflets, discussing research ideas and priorities, giving a carer\u2019s perspective on an issue or helping to spread the results of research.</p><p>Involving People encourage involvement in research by:</p><p>Coordinating opportunities for patients, carers and service users to get involved, providing information, support and training.</p><p>Providing researchers with advice on best practice and linking them with patients, carers, service users who are prepared and willing to get involved.</p><p>They believe that involving people leads to research that is more relevant to people\u2019s needs and concerns, is more reliable and is more likely to be used to improve health and social care services. <a id=\"External_Link\" name=\"External_Link\"></a></p><h2>External Link</h2><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.involvingpeople.org.uk/welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.involvingpeople.org.uk/welcome\">Involving People</a></p>", "title": "Involving People"}

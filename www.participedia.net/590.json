Cases can be contemporary or historical, completed or ongoing.</p><p>METHOD: Articles about Methods provide information on the many processes used to guide innovations in participatory politics and overnance, suchas citizen juries, deliberative polling and participatory budgeting.</p><p>ORGANIZATION: Articles about Organizations provide profiles of formal and informal groups that design, implement or support innovations in participatory politics and governance.\u00a0</p><h3>Contributing Content to Participedia</h3><p>It is very easy for anyone to contribute content to Participedia about a case, method, or organization. Please\u00a0<strong><a href=\"/user/register\">register today</a></strong>\u00a0so that you can contribute to the site; you will need to register in order to add or edit articles, or participate in discussions.</p><p>Once you are registered and logged in, you can contribute in several ways:</p><ol><li><em>Create a new case, method or organization article.</em>\u00a0From the\u00a0<strong><a href=\"/create-content\">Create Content</a></strong>\u00a0page, choose the type of article you would like to draft. You don't have to be ready to write a complete article; you just need to get the article started. (If you just want to suggest an article for someone else to write, just enter the title of your article, and choose \"stub\" from the completeness drop-down.) Tabs toward the top of the entry form (for example, \u201cpurpose, history, participants\u201d etc.) help guide you through the form. Some fields are open and ask you submit text, including a brief narrative description. Other fields prompt you to select from lists of possible responses.</li><li><em>Edit or add to an existing entry.\u00a0</em>While viewing a case, method or organization article, click the \"edit\" tab at the top of the article to jump in and add to or amend the current entry. The \"Revisions\" tab allows you to display of all the contributors to the article and when they made their contribution.<br/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://participedia.net/sites/default/files/Contributing%20Content-Fig%201-New.png\"/><br/>\u00a0</li><li><em>Start or join a discussion.</em>\u00a0You can comment on any case, method or organization by starting a discussion thread on that specific article. These discussions are a good way to flag an issue that needs further consideration or coverage, or to raise concerns about past revisions to an article. Just as every Wikipedia entry has a \"discussion\" tab for debates over that entry, we hope Participedians will engage in lively debates about our articles. You can start a new discussion on any entry, or if there is a discussion already underway, join in.\u00a0<br/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://participedia.net/sites/default/files/Contributing%20Content-Fig%202-New.png\"/><br/>\u00a0</li><li><em>Nominate a Case, Method or Organization.</em>\u00a0Help grow the Participedia community by suggesting a potential Case, Method or Organization that you think should be added to the site.

This essentially keeps Them out of reach of many good causes - because They don't want to join any real-world entities. They just don't want to join street protests, parties, etc.</p><p>Freerz Community is a means for Them to be able to fight for worthy causes - in the virtual world - without associating themselves with any real-world entities.</p><p>Our world view is simple: <strong>All is One - One is All - All is All</strong>.</p><h3>History</h3><strong>Until its Dawning - a history of oppression and hope</strong>\u00a0It was \u00a0the \u00a0mid-sixties in Central-Europe, when the then-Hungarian\u00a0People's Army started issuing new uniforms to its troops.The old uniform was a soviet lookalike,contrary to the newly issued one,that represented some traditional \u00a0Hungarian look. This move, that occured in 1965, ended a decade of bitter memories of the famous 1956 Uprising.However invading soviet forces were still in place, but at least distinction between the soviet and hungarian soldiers became possible. Naturally, this move was aimed at the \u00a0general \u00a0population to hide the \u00a0oppressive nature of the regime,but interestingly it caused the most effect to those,who intended to wear these, the soldiers, or at least, a part of them.\u00a0In Hungary, as in most countries those days, a mandatory draft systemwas in effect. According to this,all males between the ages of 18 and 36 were subject to \u00a0military service. As with most mandatory regulations in most countries, it usually only applied to the poor. Party members' sonswere \u00a0transferred to \u00a0more \u00a0convenient \u00a0places, while \u00a0those \u00a0dubbed \u00a0as 'enemies-of-the-system' were dispatched to near-labour camps,referred to as 'Engineering Brigades'. The difference between the poor and the rich, and between the \u00a0sons of the ruling elite and the \u00a0ordinary folk were so obvious, that it was crystal clear for everyone.\u00a0To add more pressure for those, who served their country a system ofpolitical \u00a0comissariat \u00a0was \u00a0working alongside \u00a0each units. A \u00a0political officer was operating at company-level -this meant that a party comissar overlooked \u00a0the daily \u00a0life of the \u00a0units. At least \u00a0one such \u00a0spook was assigned to \u00a0every 50-100 men. For an Army of \u00a0some 120-200.000 it meanthell of a \u00a0high level of \u00a0suspicion, one might say. Needless \u00a0to say, as oppressive \u00a0regimes go, no opposition parties \u00a0or even \u00a0thoughts \u00a0were allowed to exist, neither in the public, nor in the armed forces.\u00a0These \u00a0factors \u00a0altogether \u00a0created an \u00a0atmosphere \u00a0of \u00a0suspicion and untrustworthyness. Hence these developments,social groups tended to stick together while on service.Because of the high level of surveillance they encountered, they were secretly aligned into \u00a0small cells. The first of such groups was the 'Rural Brotherhood', composed of agrarian-background fellow \u00a0countrymen. Of course, being subject to martial law as soldiers, they weren't keen to commit anything that \u00a0might be seen as an open revolt or such.\u00a0\u00a0Over the decades \u00a0these \u00a0secretive \u00a0groups \u00a0transformed \u00a0into \u00a0secret\u00a0societies, and divided along their \u00a0common interests and goals. A number of these \u00a0operated pretty \u00a0secretive nets of cells at almost every unit. There were \u00a0ones that operated in \u00a0order to help each other to dissidate to the \u00a0West, others were \u00a0centered \u00a0on \u00a0defending \u00a0each \u00a0other against offences. Finally there were some, whose members were trying to make the most of \u00a0their \u00a0stay: \u00a0writing \u00a0 memoires, engaging \u00a0in \u00a0philosophical discussions in order to 'Change the World'.\u00a0Such groups would probably \u00a0end up in discontent, but as \u00a0its members\u00a0were \u00a0changed every \u00a0one to three years, there were \u00a0always \u00a0fresh blood - and fresh ideas. After nearly fourty years,the Cold War came to an end, and these groups also - however their legacy continued.\u00a0From around 1989,these societies were transformed their thoughts ontoa whole \u00a0other theater: the \u00a0post-Internet World. In August of 2001, thelast such society ceased to exist,with the discharge of its last members from \u00a0the \u00a0now \u00a0democratic \u00a0Hungarian Defence Forces. \u00a0This \u00a0last secret society was named \u00a0<em>'The Rabapon-E Brotherhood</em>'. (Its name derived from a strong industrial cleaning solvent that was used at the army barracks at that time.)\u00a0\u00a0The former Members of the Rabapon-E created the Freerz Community and spread the light to three continents. Before going online, the Freerz had Units in Australia, Canada, UK, Italy, Germany, Austria and Hungary.<h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Freerz Community has specialist Units under development, but basically most Members are engaging in all kinds of tasks.</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3>To name a few recent projects:\u00a0\u00a0There was a project a few months back where separate FRZ units (one in Australia, one in Canada, one in Italy and one in Hungary) researched immigration &amp; indigenous reaction to the immigration. Contrary to most such researches We did not focused on socio-political factors, but the access to resources by the various groups. The research concluded that the immigration and the violent xenophobic phenomenon are both based on the lack of access to resources and information. The exiles/refugees are usually denied access to resources and information at the starting point of their journey, while those sounding xenophobic voices are too lacking reliable information (and as such resources) about those coming into their countries. Of course there are many more circumstances that are effecting this issue, but We managed to prove valid points that were put into practice by some western countries immigration laws since.\u00a0Also a Freerz Unit was specifically designed a framework structure for an international disaster relief/response model that could be quickly activated, logistically feasible and staffed with eager and trained volunteers. Parts of this latter project were implemented in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake in 2010.<h3>Funding</h3><p>The Freerz Comunity is a non-profit organization and has no funding plans.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://freerz.org\">http://freerz.org</a></p><h1>(We strongly advise to read the Freerz Manifesto first, in order to understand the core principles We believe in. <a href=\"http://freerz.org\">http://freerz.org</a>)</h1>", "title": "The Freerz Community"}

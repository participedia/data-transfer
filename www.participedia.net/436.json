Notice I used the singular. That's because there is really only one rule that binds Super PACs: that they may not coordinate with candidates' campaigns. But what fun is buying somebody an election if you have no elected official to share the moment with?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>America Crossroads' Karl Rove saw through this sham of a charade \u2013 or \"<em>shamrade</em>\u2122\" \u2013 and petitioned the F.E.C. to clarify exactly what the law is, so he can carefully obey only the letter of it.

Therefore, an evaluation of the group\u2019s success or failure must account for these differences in goals with respect to time.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Certainly, the fact that land seizures and evictions still occur in China<a href=\"#_ftn5\" id=\"_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a> would imply that the videogame platform mentioned earlier has been unsuccessful <em>if</em> the videogame makers\u2019 goal was to cause immediate change in Chinese development policy.\u00a0 However, if the goal of the gamers was to inform, educate, and mobilize a large audience in opposition to Chinese land development policies, then it may have succeeded (at least, in part).\u00a0 The videogame has reached tens of thousands of people and generated widespread discussion on social media platforms.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" id=\"_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a></p><br clear=\"all\"/><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> (<em>Cao Ni Ma</em>)\u00a0 A play on the Mandarin words for \u201cfuck your mother.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftn2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Diamond, Larry.\u00a0 <em>Journal of Democracy Volume 21, Number 3. \u201cLiberation Technology.\u201d July 2010.</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" id=\"_ftn3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> Ye, Juliet and Emma Ashburn. \u201c<em>Fighting Eviction:\u00a0 The Videogame</em>.\u201d <em>The Wall Street Journal. \u00a016 Sept 2010</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" id=\"_ftn4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> Carr, David. \u201c<em>Comic\u2019s PAC Is More than a Gag.\u201d The New York Times. 22 Aug 2011</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" id=\"_ftn5\" name=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\">[5]</a> Jacobs, Andrew. \u201c<em>Harassment and Evictions Bedevil Even China\u2019s Well-Off.\u201d \u00a0The New York Times</em>. 27 Oct 2011</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" id=\"_ftn6\" name=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\">[6]</a> Ye, Juliet and Emma Ashburn. \u201c<em>Fighting Eviction:\u00a0 The Videogame</em>.\u201d <em>The Wall Street Journal. \u00a016 Sept 2010</em></p><h3>Conclusions and Implications</h3><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Perhaps Colbert\u2019s intention was to prove a point about money in politics and inform the public of a real threat to democracy, but he may have inadvertently helped to catalyze the next generation of protesters in America.\u00a0 It is not a coincidence that the same issues raised by the Colbert Super PAC are echoed by the OCCUPY movements which have sprouted in several US cities in recent months.\u00a0 In fact, Sophia A. McClennen, a Professor at Penn State University, recently wrote an op-ed piece titled \u201cHas the Colbert Nation Occupied Wall Street?\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn1\" id=\"_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the article, McClennen writes, \u201cacross the globe and from US city to US city, we watch daily as waves of protesters, many of them young, take to the streets. Such images seemed impossible five years ago. Back then the mainstream buzz was that the youth were \u201cstoned slackers\u201d \u2014 too narcissistic and tech obsessed to engage in real protest. Where did all of this young activist energy come from?\u00a0 The Colbert Nation \u2026 In the space created by his ironic satire he encourages his audience to question the media, politicians, and the power structure in ways that are not totally dissimilar to OWS \u2026 missing that connection, though, means missing the art of satire since satirical humor mocks those who make a folly of politics and it exposes social absurdities that the public has come to take for granted. Such a form of mockery is the first step in showing the public that they can challenge the status quo \u2026 But aren\u2019t Colbert\u2019s fans just fans? Don\u2019t they just follow him? And aren\u2019t they having too much fun tweeting and editing Wikipedia entries to be serious about activism? The \u201cit getters\u201d of the Colbert Nation know that they can make a public impact, challenge authority, and enjoy themselves at the same time.\u201d<a href=\"#_ftn2\" id=\"_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Clearly, the Colbert Super PAC is changing the way people engage in civic discourse in the United States.\u00a0 Also, it appears that the group could become a platform for previously disaffected or disillusioned citizens to learn skills and build networks which may spillover in to other forms of participation, as seen in the OCCUPY movements.</p><br clear=\"all\"/><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" id=\"_ftn1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> McClennen, Sophia A. \u201c<em>Has the Colbert Nation Occupied Wall Street?\u201d 14 Nov 2011.</em></p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" id=\"_ftn2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> <em>Ibid.</em></p><h3>Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://colbertsuperpac.com/\">http://colbertsuperpac.com/</a> \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><a href=\"http://colbertsuperpac.com/episodeiv-anewhope/index.php\">http://colbertsuperpac.com/episodeiv-anewhope/index.php</a> \u00a0</p><h3>Sources:</h3><p>Colbert Super PAC logo courtesy of ColbertSuperPAC.com</p><h3>\u00a0</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>\u00a0</h3><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "Colbert Super PAC"}

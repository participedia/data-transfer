The more volunteer support you can find the lower the costs will be. The maximum cost is estimated to be the amount if a single round (of perhaps 1000-2000 participants) is totally underwritten for all elements: video production of the issue(s), printing, distribution, meeting management, public relations, web support, etc. This amount should be within the financial means of philanthropic organizations and/or government assistance programs.</p><p>For more information, please leave a message for John Spady\u00a0at: +1-206-296-1633. I will return your call asap.</p><p><img src=\"http://participedia.net/sites/default/files/images/methods/CoreValues.gif\"/></p>", "title": "Citizen Councilor Network"}

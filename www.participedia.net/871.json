This planning is executed for the budget of every fiscal year.</p><p>Municipal Resolution 43 from 2007 creates and institutionalizes local planning and participatory budgeting within the framework of the Planning Municipal System (Resolution 043 of 1996)</p><p>Medell\u00edn\u2019s Municipal Planning System is composed of three subsystems:</p>1.

In any case, the total value of the component cannot be lower than 5 percent of the prosed investment of the municipality in each annual period.\u00a0 The Administrative Department on Municipal Planning will distribute the Participatory Budgeting for communes and jurisdiction according to population criteria, human development index, quality of life index, among others which guarantee principles of social equity and territorial solidarity.</p><p>In order to institutionalize and legitimatize the local development planning process, participatory planning bodies within the purview of communities and jurisdictions.</p><ul><li>Urban Area Communal Councils</li><li>Rural Zone Jurisdictional Councils</li><li>Urban Zone Neighborhood Assemblies</li><li>Rural Zone Village Assemblies</li></ul><p>They also are also included in the Thematic Commissions (Comisiones Tem\u00e1ticas) system which work in accordance with the structure of the Local Development Plans and the planning process\u2019s dynamics in each community or jurisdiction. Taking in account the garnered experience of Participatory Budgeting or in the case that no Local Development Plan exists, it is recommended that commissions are created according to the thematic frame in various interest areas (Education, culture, recreation and sports, environment, coexistence, etc.)</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><ul><li>The Medellin City Hall</li><li>European Union Cooperation (Community Participation Project for development planning, public investments, and productivity 2011-2013)</li></ul><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p><strong>Communal Council and Jurisdictional Council</strong>: This group is the ultimate counselor in the participatory planning in each one of the communities and jurisdiction.

As a planning body, it seeks to broaden and secure citizen participation both in local planning and in the participatory budgeting in the communes and jurisdictions. They will be convened by the JAL with the support of the administration.<p>Whoever wishes to participate must correspondingly register in Medellin\u2019s Agency of the Social Development Secretariat of the City Hall, or in the communities and jurisdictions at the sites and timelines stipulated by each period.</p><p>There are requirements for the organizations which wish to enroll a candidate to participation as a representative and also for those who wish to do it on behalf of the Neighborhood or Village Assembly.</p><p>Admitted and elected delegates will participate in the program and shall mandatorily assist in training sessions on topics related with Local Planning and Participatory Planning.

Annual budget allocation for each community and jurisdiction within the framework of the Annual Investments Operation Plan in its respective validity period. Resources are distributed as follows:</p><ul><li>Number of inhabitants: 40 percent (larger populations receive more funds)</li><li>Quality of life index: 35 percent (areas with lower life quality receives more resources)</li><li>Participation in Neighborhood and Village Assemblies 25 percent (areas with more participation receives more funds)</li></ul><p>2.

Aspiring Candidates present themselves to delegates before the community where the public compromise on transparency is signed.\u00a0 A representative is elected to the Ballot Commission and the voting mechanism which is implemented at the Election and Prioritization Meeting is explained.</li><li>Second point: The Election and Prioritization Meeting is the second moment where voting occurs to elect delegates which make up the Communal and Jurisdictional Councils.</li></ul><p>Electors select priorities in each neighborhood and village at these Meetings. This serves as key input in establishing issues which will be financed with resources from Local Planning and Participatory Budgeting.</p><p>3.\u00a0 Holding of Communal and Jurisdictional Councils in distinct phases of the process:\u00a0 assessments, prioritization, approval of the participatory budget, monitoring, and follow up on the implementation.</p><p>The Communal and Jurisdictional Councils are the summit for the process\u2019s planning. Here, elected delegates from each commune and jurisdiction decide and approve the initiatives in which the community finds interest and would 5 percent of municipal resources. The investment of these recourse is done with the aim of resolving the most pressing needs in each territory through the Thematic Commissions (Comisiones Tem\u00e1ticas).</p><p>4. Endorsement of the decision taken by the Communal and Jurisdictional Council by a ruling in the Board Administrator Local (JAL) which is delivered to the Administrative Department of Planning.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>This process allow for a recognition of necessities and ways of thinking among women, men, youth, adults, senior citizens, indigenous populations, afro-descendant peoples, the LGTB community, the handicapped, and displaced groups.\u00a0 This thereby also recognizes that everyone lives in the city and has the right to a dignified life filled with respect for diversity.</p><p>This has permitted citizens to influence in the allotment of municipal resources through the prioritization of demands and necessities in order to integrate the development of the city into the same process of local development in their communes and jurisdictions.

The priorities set forth in the process of participatory budgeting are taken in account in the city\u2019s budget.</p><p>The participatory budget resulting from these meetings are made available by posting and publishing. Likewise, every year\u2019s participatory budget\u2019s implementation matrix is published.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>This is a space to participate and speak with the aim that together, through reunions and gatherings, a destiny and history of the city is built. Diverse opinions are therefore weighed in deciding the best for the community, particularly in respect to what is subject in the process (num. 1). One can qualify this as an inclusive and informative deliberative process which supports the empowerment of citizens.</p><p>Additionally, the dynamic in local planning and participatory budgeting is consolidated as an exercise in transparency in the management of municipal resource which demands for a co-responsibility among all citizens.</p><p>The publishing and follow-up on the results and the resource allotment methods are factors which motivate and promote participation among great numbers of citizens in the process.</p><p>The process also had a political education phase for adult citizens and in particular for the delegates.</p><p>This is an intermediate process between democratic authorities and the direct participation of citizens, taking into account that in the phases where decisions are made through the delegates thereby supporting participatory democracy.\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ul><li>ABC de la Planeaci\u00f3n Local y Presupuesto Participativo Medell\u00edn 2011</li><li>Acuerdo Municipal N\u00b0 43 de 2007</li><li>Decreto No. 1073 de 2009</li></ul><h3>External Links</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.medellin.gov.co/\">www.medellin.gov.co</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.inder.gov.co/\">http://www.inder.gov.co</a></li><li><a href=\"http://customers.gkudos.com/delcol/sigweb/php/hojaProyectoPublico.php?idproyecto=576\">http://customers.gkudos.com/delcol/sigweb/php/hojaProyectoPublico.php?id...</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]</li><li><a href=\"http://www.medellin.gov.co/irj/portal/ciudadanos?NavigationTarget=navurl://b43b50260ac423f7ce6238eabc2ee326\">http://www.medellin.gov.co/irj/portal/ciudadanos?NavigationTarget=navurl...</a>\u00a0[DEAD LINK]</li></ul>", "title": "Medell\u00edn, Colombia.

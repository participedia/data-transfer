{"htmlbody": "<p>Preparing a write-up of this case will require knowledge of Portuguese (PBcensus 1 - complete raw data). Although there are no existing case studies in English on Alagoinhas, the city was surveyed in the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census\">Participatory Budgeting Census 2012 </a>(Spada et al.). Thus, many of the fixed data fields provided by Participedia are complete. (The fixed data fields can be accessed and edited by logging onto this site and selecting the \u201cedit\u201d tab above the title of the case. Please see the \"help\" section on \"contributing content\" for additional guidance.)</p><p>The PB process in Alagoinhas was initiated in 2001 and appears to be ongoing in 2015.

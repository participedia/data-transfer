It was originally hosted by the [<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Community_Audit_%26_Evaluation_Centre\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Community_Audit_%26_Evaluation_Centre\">Community Audit and Evaluation Centre</a>] at Manchester Metropolitan University, but was constituted as an independent Community Interest Company in January 2009.</p><p>The seeds of the GAP Unit were sown by the GEM Project\u2014 participatory research into the gender dynamics of community engagement in Manchester, which was carried out by Manchester Women\u2019s Network. The research found that women were under-represented in political decision-making in the city , particularly at higher levels. Dissemination of the findings led to advocacy work and development of training programmes to help address some of the needs and gaps identified. These included greater general understanding of gender equality issues within the community, voluntary and public sectors, and confidence building for women, who were generally less comfortable than men in formal public meetings.</p><p>The GEM Project team set up the GAP Unit in response to a high demand for advice and training from local and regional organisations, big and small. They also wanted to be able to provide support to grassroots women\u2019s groups, through self-esteem and empowerment projects and other activities based on the principles of participatory community education. <a id=\"Specializations_and_activities\" name=\"Specializations_and_activities\"></a></p><h2>Specializations and activities</h2><p>GAP unit specialises in the following areas Community development, Research and consultancy (using a variety of participatory research methods) as well as Training (in Gender, diversity and inequality; Capacity building; Research methods; and Empowerment sessions). <a id=\"External_Links\" name=\"External_Links\"></a></p><h2>External Links</h2><p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.gapunit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.gapunit.org/\">GAP Unit</a></p>", "title": "GAP Unit"}

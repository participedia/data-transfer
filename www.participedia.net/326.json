IISD has a main goal of uniting people to have an opportunity to talk that have intense backgrounds. Sustained Dialogue is identified as finding causal relationships that hinder the process of deliberation to occur. The process of Sustained Dialogue is to provide a space to produce the capacities necessary, to practice these capacities, and to create the relationships vital to political and economic democracy . <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.sustaineddialogue.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.sustaineddialogue.org\">http://www.sustaineddialogue.org</a></p>", "title": "Sustained Dialogue Institute "}

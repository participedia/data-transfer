Workshop topics include: talking across partisan divides, journalism\u2019s role in public engagement, online civic dialogue, and enlisting local government to collaborate with citizens. More information on the conference is available at <u><a href=\"http://www.ncdd.org/events\" target=\"_blank\">www.ncdd.org/events</a></u>.</p><p>In keeping with the spirit of the conference and to honor NCDD\u2019s 10th anniversary, the organization has also launched a pair of $10,000 awards to move the national conversation in a different\u2014and healthier\u2014direction. The NCDD Catalyst Awards will encourage leaders and innovators in the fields of public engagement, conflict resolution, and community problem solving to combine forces to develop projects that jump-start the field\u2019s next best ideas and impact our communities\u2019 and our country\u2019s ability to solve its most challenging problems.</p><p>The <strong>Civic Infrastructure </strong>category, funded primarily by donations from the NCDD Board of Directors, will launch a collaborative project that uniquely helps build a more robust, sustainable civic infrastructure in communities and the country, and will sustain the public\u2019s collective long-term capacity to come together to solve problems and build thriving communities.</p><p>The <strong>Bridge Building</strong> category will provide seed funds for a collaborative project that best enables people to talk and work together constructively during a time of intense political polarization. Funding for the award comes from private donors Roger Harrison and Margaret Harris.</p><p>\u201cWe see these awards as powerful tools to energize not only the dialogue and deliberation community, but also the public officials and citizens who could use dialogue to grapple with the issues we live with every day,\u201d said Sandy Heierbacher, NCDD executive director. \u201cWe are so proud to play a role in moving our country away from partisan rancor and toward a culture where people can hear one another and bridge their divides.\u201d</p><p>Both awards will be formally introduced at NCDD\u2019s national conference. As part of the awards process, members will vote for their favorite entries, and the winners will be announced in January.

The surveys shows that during 2001-2004, some of the projects were not linked with a specific plan\u00a0 and they\u00a0 not regulated the budget. At the same time, there were some\u00a0 weaknesses\u00a0 in the structure and\u00a0 the formulation, deliberation, decisions and\u00a0 the projects was affected drastically as aconsequence of this,meaning that the porjects could not\u00a0 end with\u00a0 successful result. Another problem was\u00a0 Open house was used for elections rather than political participation and some of the senior officlas would\u00a0 send the delegates who did not have the power to make decicions without the high functioning delegates being presented.This made\u00a0 progress slow in the meetings and outcome were not decide on. At the same time,as the slow decision making grinding progress to a halt,55% of the population\u00a0 argue that the methodology used was not succesful<strong>.</strong> (Form of the evaluation Ex-post ,2015).</p><p>For instance in 2004, according to the Form of the evaluation\u00a0 only 241 out of 739 projects were accomplished (Form of the evaluation Ex,1995,p.18). This represented 32,6% which is a small percentages. As a consequences of this the participation substantially declined because\u00a0 civilians\u00a0 not trust in the goverment. In contrast, during the last\u00a0 few years this changed\u00a0 completely with the government working towards and accomplishing all the goals,providing\u00a0 a better life for the civilians.\u00a0</p><p>The purpose of the Cabildo Abierto is to encourage the population to participate in the projects and express their necesitites and gave the decision making power to the civilians in the hope it would benefit society as a whole.The methodology of community and social are designed as a vehicle to improve the communication between the civilians,the majors and those who work in the government.This in turn creates a close relationship and space whereby all participants can lisent to, propose different projects and enforce effective adminsitration.The feasibility of budgets,and distribution of them is easily tackled and ensures communities find effective solutions together.(Colombian Constitution,1994,law 134,Art.81-89).</p><h3>History</h3><p>Historically speaking,the ``Cabildo abierto `` or Open House\u00a0 is defined as a mechanism of citizen participation that is made up by public meeting of district,municipal or local administration parish councils, in which the inhabitants are able to participate directly, aiming to discuss issues of interest for the community.(Colombian Political Constitution, 1991, Article 98).</p><p>This mechanism was established by the Constitution of 1991 in Colombia which aimed to extend\u00a0 the representative democracy limits and re-evaluate the role of citizens, making it the Social State under the Rule of law. This was significant to the participatory democracy because it gave\u00a0 equality between men and women, and an active sovereign citizenship that allows all the right to participate in a public life.</p><p>In the memorable period, indigenous did several meetings and worked together in order to improve their standards of life. This democratic action was called ``Minga\u00a0 de Pensamiento.The word Minga means collective agriculture work that benefits the tribe. This is a remarkable period that influenced the participatory budgeting in Pasto that today is called `Cabildo Abierto` . This is an effective instrument that creates strength via democracy and imporves the relationship between the Government and Civilians as it encourages active participation from both sides.</p><p>In 1996\u00a0 under the Government of Antonio Navarro Wolf, was organised for the first time the Participatory budgeting at Pasto. He organised the first meetings of Open house started in rural sector and a development plan called `Everything for Pasto``.Open house in the municipality of Pasto have a particular characteristic that is an onging Project that has passed trough seven different administrations. Following this,the second phase\u00a0 was in 2001 with the administration of Eduardo Alvarado Santander,whose aim was to expand the Open House.He expanded\u00a0 to include\u00a0 10 township and 12 Communes with a new theoretical process and more advance methodology. This brought positive effects involving more civilians.</p><p>Elected in 2004,Major Ra\u00f9l Delagado Guerra, continued the process by significantly advancing\u00a0 the process and quality of\u00a0 participation between civilians and the structure of the meetings. Emphasising\u00a0 and strengthening the methodological route,creating better standards of life for all.</p><p>Subsequently,with the fourth phase was between 2008 and 2011 by Eduardo Alvarado,he emphasised the\u00a0 importance of social inclusi\u00f3n,with his Government in turn imporving the structure and methodology that was a already in place.</p><p>The last administration bengan in 2012 until present, with Major Harold Guerrero Lopez\u00a0 assuming the challenge to legitimized\u00a0 the participation as a part of the cultural history.This administration is creating a new methodology to improve the efficient of open house doing surveys,evaluations and lisent the petitions of the people.</p><p>All in all, Pasto have a relevant historical culture that directly\u00a0 influence\u00a0 the Open house has increase the percentages of\u00a0 participation.Today, it is well know\u00a0 that as the\u00a0 pioneer of this democratic innovation,it was\u00a0 taken as a model and\u00a0 implemented in others regions of Colombia.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The three main entities are,Firstlly the Municipal Register of Pasto whoes aim is to check\u00a0 the amount of the signatures that was recollected to disccus and tackle\u00a0 a specific issue in the meetings and regualte the sessions of the Cabildo Abierto.</p><p>Secondly, the Town hall whose aim is to regualte the projects and investments that\u00a0 the Local Adminsitrative Councils have been doing.Thus the Local Administrative Councils mision is to present investment proposals to the authorities in order to distribute global payments from the municipal Budget and their municipalities under the juridiction.</p><p>The last one is the National Council for Participation is one of the organ that provides advice to the national government\u00a0 on the definition,promotion,conception follow up and evaluation of government.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Cabildo Abierto in Pasto is integrated by the Major that is elected by the population. The Major and the population work together with a municipal programme which the Major is\u00a0 responsible for the political feasibility\u00a0 and\u00a0 effectiveness of the projects.The\u00a0 second component is the communal actions which\u00a0 are essential\u00a0 for the Cabildos because it\u00a0 gives the opportunity to each local to think about the projects,budgets and the Development Plan bringing positive effects the public sector as the neighbour and the municipal administration. The third\u00a0 spokesman are the leaders of the civilians that represent the commune or township, they select five for Micro Territorial Unit whose mission is to select by voting\u00a0 the priority\u00a0 projects in the assemblies by participating in the meetings and writting up report to distribute to the community. The fourth,is\u00a0 NGOS give support to the leaders and assitance to the planning system and participatory budget.</p><p>Finally of the above, Open house are supported by\u00a0 a group of professionals of the municipal sector or volunteers\u00a0 that are integrated into the municipal ;administration.The main role is to introduce an effective\u00a0 methodology in both financial and judicial aspect in allowing effective order of the projects.</p><p>In terms of the mechanism of participation, meetings were and still open to\u00a0 everyone\u00a0 and\u00a0 could be able to propose a project to the specific secretary within 15 days before\u00a0 the session begins. (Colombia Constitution,Article 48).</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>In context, Cabildo Abierto` in Pasto created an impact for the civilians because the number of participation have been increased,thus why the population trusted more in\u00a0 the government. The statistics show that approximately 16 million\u00a0 civilians participate and the young population represent the biggest percentage. The last years, more people have been participating in the Comercial meetings, 44 %\u00a0 of people with 110 leaders representing the community (Montufar,2012,p.19).</p><p>Cabildo Abierto transfer the power to the community, providing opportunities for freedom speech and the ability to make their own decisions.One of the\u00a0 Majors steps forward to this democratic innovation is that civilians are getting more involved, working together to have a better standard of life, while building strong relationship between the civilians and the majors and is more transparent,inclusive and efficient.</p><p>According to\u00a0 Scholars, Roberto Bobbio\u00a0 and Robert Dahl\u00a0 it is arguable that the democracy innovations need to provide conditions that guarantee the Freedom of Speech\u00a0 otherwise is not going to be achieve without exclusion or effective administration (Bobbio,1999,p16). In this case of study\u00a0 it was shown that in an attempt to satisfy all criteria and have efficient deliberation and communication to tackle the issues it was vital to recognise to gather people in the smaller towns and more isolated regions.</p><p>It is important to note that over the years,there is a evidence\u00a0 that show some difficulties to accomplished all the projects, but the government is continuously working on implementing new practices.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Over the years some scholars have\u00a0 criticised the participatory budgeting arguing that is not effective because there is a large of\u00a0 corruption within the Government making it difficult to complete all the projects and offer solutions to all issues raised. Perhaps Cabildo Abierto brought to the Civilians the opportunity to be involved with the political and economic sphere, allownig the people power to make decisions and\u00a0 ensuaring the transparency of the process.This in itself would be\u00a0 an advantage to the community as\u00a0 they would know where the money was being invested.</p><p>For example, in 2003 the Government invested in the constructions of schools and sports buildings and this benefits the children. (City Municipality of Pasto, Cabildo Team\u00a0 2008-2011).</p><p>\u00a0At the same time the Major Harold Guerrero and the Government Officials have been\u00a0 improving\u00a0 the structure of Cabildo Abierto,creating\u00a0 new programs such as a new School of Leadership and Democratic Participation, which aimed\u00a0 to prepare and give more knowledge to\u00a0 civilians through Courses supporting by the Nari\u00f1o University, Sena and San Martin University. Some of the projects that have been proposed by the civilians include :</p><p>-The construction of\u00a0 a Health Centre\u00a0 of Santa Monica with a price of\u00a0 US$ 1,210,344,515.36 whose aim is to cover all the needs of the civilians who do not have adequate resources.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The construction of\u00a0 platforms for\u00a0 people with\u00a0 disabilities and the maintenance needed at a\u00a0 price of USD $341,664,540.60.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investing in the improve of education for children, in the municipal Ecano with a price of \u00a371,956.80.( Form of the evaluation Ex-post ,2015).</p><p>All in all, Cabildo Abierto in Pasto is a successful example of a democratic liberation whereby was influenced by the indigenous. Today this is a useful instrument for communities working together to solve\u00a0 problems and is a good exercise example of democracy working well.Democracy not only makes citizens more aware of their community but ensures they work together as they argue for a better Pasto.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>\u00a0This case of study is interesting\u00a0 as it shows how `Cabildo Abierto `in Pasto worked as a democratic innovations\u00a0 an\u00a0\u00a0 the impact on other collective spheres and institutions.It successfully encouraged people to work of different ages and allowed decisions to be made by those who would be directly affected. This area of innovation, the participatory budgeting, started in the 1990\u2019s in Latin America such as Brazil (Porto Alegre) and Colombia, with the common aim to make representative democracy open to more active participation by the civilians. This innovative idea encouraged programmes that persuaded the minds of different people to move away from individualism and towards community solidarity, working together to improve standards of life.(Amaya y Leon,2004).</p><p>Although the two examples mentioned above use this instruments to\u00a0 achieve the same aim, there some difference\u00a0 in the structure and mechanism.On\u00a0 the one hand, Participatory budgeting in Brazil led the citizens choose the project in which the money is going to be invest and they have the right to vote for it and promote the engage of the poor citizens ( Diaz,1999).</p><p>On the other hand in Colombia\u00a0 Participatory budgeting started under the name of Open House because was created by the indigenous.The Open House is defined as a mechanism of citizen participation that have public meeting of district,municipal or local administrative parish councils,allowing civilians\u00a0 to directly participate aiming to discuss\u00a0 common issues. (Diaz,1999). At the same time, the government\u00a0 need to provide information to the citizens about the work that they have been doing and the budget and listen to the issues of the community to find a effective solution.Additionally, is inclusive because it does not have a limit number\u00a0 of people and is open to everyone.</p><p>In\u00a0 context the Participatory budgeting\u00a0 in the municipality of Pasto have been\u00a0 operating successfully for 20 years and\u00a0 it is highly attractive how the different administrations\u00a0 tackle the\u00a0 issues,while still providing equal opportunities for the civilians. However,there are some questions\u00a0 concerning the effectiveness and transparency of the process that some scholars have been asked. For example, to what extent are citizens able to influence the political decision? ,Do they affect how government spends the money?, Is this process transparent ?, Does the opinion of the civilians matter?. This is one of the challenges that faces the \u201cCabildo Abierto\u201d because high levels of cooperation from civilians are needed, and they are actively encouraged to participate. For this a completely transparent system is needed.(Diaz,1999).</p><p>In Pasto the Government has been regulated by the City Hall which has special institutions to supervise and analyse the processes used. It is important to note that this is not always the case and that now a higher percentage of civilians are completely involved with all projects and meetings. Civilians also have the power to check outcomes with the right to vote and change the Government. (Smith,2009,p.61).</p><p>It is clear that\u00a0 are some difficulties and challenges as raised above. Although, the municipality of Pasto led\u00a0 to a significant and efficient model of political participation, having more active participants, some extending to the more vulnerable areas that need more help. This in turn reduces corruption and violence and the projects have accomplished satisfying the necessities of the most vulnerable civilians.</p><p>All in all,\u00a0 there are three main aspects that this instrument have been achieve during the last years.First\u00a0 the number of civilians are increasing,this means that there are worrying and carrying\u00a0 about the community and the projects . Second,the population now are aiming for the same goals as those growing up which is \u201cto have a better pasto\u201d. Finally, the government have been working for the community and the major is more involved and care about the community.This attempt that to have a better democracy it is important the voluntary participation of the population.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><strong>- </strong>Amaya,Silvia\u00a0 and Leon,Jaime 2004,Politic History and Institutional,ed.Memory and Society V.18 No.16.</p><p>- \u00a0Bobbio, Norberto, 1987.State,Government and Society.

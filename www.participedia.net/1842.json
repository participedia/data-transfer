{"htmlbody": "<p><a id=\"_GoBack\" name=\"_GoBack\"></a>Participedia's research goal is to develop a large article and database that will support evidence-based answers to the question: What kinds of participatory processes work best, for what purposes, and under what conditions? We hope that you and other practitioners, academics, and students from across the globe will be part of this endeavor, through either <strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/content/contributing-content-participedia\">contributing content</a>\u00a0</strong>or sharing your analysis of the data found on this site.</p><p>Participedia is an experiment with a new and potentially powerful way to conduct social science research. The strategy is simple: crowd-source data on democratic innovations from around the world from contributors like yourself and then aggregate this into an open, public database that continually updates with new contributions. All of Participedia\u2019s content and data is and will remain free and publicly accessible (see our <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/legal\">Creative Commons licensing agreement</a>. By <strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/create-content\">contributing\u00a0content</a></strong>, you are not only helping to deepen knowledge of democratic innovations, but also to develop and refine this new model of social science research.</p><p>For an article-length explanation of the history, aspirations, theory and analytical approach of Participedia, check out \u2018<a href=\"http://archonfung.net/docs/articles/2011/FungParticipedia201112.pdf\">The Participedia Project: An Introduction</a>\u2019, International Public Management Journal, 14: 1-22, by the two founders of Participedia, Archon Fung and Mark E.

We provide recommendations on how to structure the narrative descriptions, although contributors are not required to follow this guidance. The result is that the quality of case descriptions varies.

In addition, we plan to collect further data on outcomes through the use of surveys that focus on the effect on participants of their involvement in participatory processes and the effect of innovations on decision making and the broader political system.</p><p>Currently a group of researchers is developing and testing two kinds of surveys to be integrated into the platform.</p><ol><li><p>Participant survey. This survey will capture the experience of participants who have been directly involved in a participatory process. It could be delivered by organizers at the location of a particular process (i.e. be part of the process evaluation), or participants could be directed to the case on Participedia and asked to complete the survey after the event.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>Observer survey. This survey will capture the views of observers of a participatory process as to the broader impact of that particular case. \u2018Observers\u2019 include practitioners, participants or researchers with particular knowledge of that case. This would represent an innovative approach to the evaluation of outcomes.</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>Data repository</p></li></ul><p>A great deal of research on democratic innovations and participatory processes takes place around the world that is not publicly available \u2013 it sits on researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 desks (or more specifically, their computers!). This includes large datasets as well as graduate and postgraduate dissertations and practitioner evaluations and reports. We aim to find a home for such research in an accessible and organized data repository. Where possible we will link the data to the cases, methods and organizations on the platform.</p><ul><li><p>Improved map and other data visualization</p></li></ul><p>We aim to improve the map on the home page map to represent the different characteristics of participatory initiatives around the world in a more visually arresting and useful manner. More generally, our aim is to partner with organizations and individuals to improve our use of data visualization tools.</p><ul><li><p>Methods and organization data download</p></li></ul><p>We have spent a lot of time cleaning up the data download process for cases. Currently the datasets for methods and organizations are not reliable (and there is no codebook). We aim to improve the data collection forms and data download for these two elements of the platform.</p>", "title": "Forschung"}

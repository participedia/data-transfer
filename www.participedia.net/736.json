{"htmlbody": "<h3><u>Definition</u></h3><p>The Pittsfield School\u00a0 District discovered they\u00a0needed to re-vamp their school systems. With a grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation they started research into how they could transform their schools. The main focus was designing a community conversation to help uncover teh underlying issues and develop possible solutions. This is the beginning of what plans to be a long-term plan of change.</p><h3><u>Problems and Purpose</u></h3><p><strong>The Pittsfield New Hampshire School District recognized that their schools, most particularly the Middle School, needed to tranforms to a student-centered learning environment that would motivate their students. They also were focused on bringing up graduation rates, college-attendance rates,</strong></p><h3><u>History</u></h3><p><strong>In December of 2010, the Pittsfield School District received a one-year planning grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation to support the transformation of\u00a0their middle -high school from a traditional school to a student-centered learning environment. Pittsfield is the only community in New Hampshire to receive one of these highly competitive grants.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>Since the grant was awarded, the Community Advisory Council - which includes many community members and community educators who have volunteered - began developing a multi-year plan for this transformation. The Council researched effective educational practices and visited successful, innovative schools to learn how to better serve\u00a0the students and\u00a0 the community.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>An important component of the planning process\u00a0was to\u00a0involve as many Pittsfield residents as possible in assessing the current state of the schools and creating concrete recommendations for improvement over the next several years. To meet this goal, the School District decided to work with the Pittsfield Youth Workshop to design a process for engaging town residents in focused conversations about the schools and community. The PYW\u00a0then partnered with NH Listens (part of the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire) to help\u00a0support these\u00a0community-wide small group dialogues. The first rounds of those community conversations occurred in August and September, 2011. </strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><strong>To begin the project, the organizations brought together a small planning group in July to help frame the key questions to be addressed and identify some of the primary issues that were likely to come up in the conversations. This group included the staff and board leadership of PYW, members of the Community Advisory Council, school employees, parents, and community leaders. The group discussed perceptions of the community and its schools, past efforts at school improvement, and ways to strengthen the school and community in the future. In order to capture the importance of the relationship between Pittsfield and its schools, the group decided that the most appropriate framing for the small group dialogues that would be taking place in August should be: <em>Strong Schools\u2014Strong Community; How can all of us make Pittsfield a great</em> <em>place for everyone to learn and live?</em></strong></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><strong>The planning group also discussed the most effective way to engage as many people as possible in the community conversations, including ways to recruit residents who often don\u2019t participate in public forums or school-related events. In order to provide input to the schools in time to be included in the next major funding proposal to the Nellie Mae Foundation, it was decided that a three-week series of small group facilitated dialogues beginning in early August would be the most effective approach.</strong></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3><u>Participant Selection</u></h3><p><strong>PYW and the planning group recruited facilitators and participants, using a variety of strategies. </strong></p><ul><li><strong>High school students worked with PYW to design fliers to promote the community conversations and attended Pittsfield Old Home Day and National Night Out to distribute the fliers and encourage residents to sign up for the conversations. </strong></li><li><strong>PYW reached out to particular groups in the community to encourage participation, including senior citizens, current high school students and recent graduates, parents who have participated in PYW programs in the past, homeschool parents, community leaders and community members who are not generally involved in the school. </strong></li><li><strong>Phone calls were made to individual residents, announcements and articles were published in the <em>Suncook Valley Sun</em>, and notices were posted on the PYW and Pittsfield School District web site.</strong></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>These efforts resulted in registration of over 60 participants, representing a diverse range of ages, occupations, length of residency in Pittsfield, and experience with the schools (some had children in the schools and some did not). However, between the time of recruitment and the beginning of the conversations more people did show interest in participating. In total 113 residents participated in the conversation.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p><strong>The community conversations began on\u00a0July 28, 2011 at the Pittsfield Fire Station. About 30 of those oringically planning to participate attended, as well as a number of residents who had not signed up. The kick-off was also attended by the School Board and school leadership as well as representatives of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. A total of about 50 residents participated in the kick-off. A combination of whole group and small group exercises were used to answer a set of four questions, listed below with the most common themes reported under each one.\u00a0The starred (*) words\u00a0were used the most often.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong><em>What words would I use to describe Pittsfield schools today?</em></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>small**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>limited**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>caring</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>improving</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>changing**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>supportive</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>needs improvement</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>dedicated**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>lack of communication between parents and teachers</em></strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I use to describe the Pittsfield community today?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><strong><em>supportive**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>friendly</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>small**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>close</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>active</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>caring**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>taxed</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>struggling**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>poor**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>shrinking</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>dedicated</strong></p></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I want to use to describe Pittsfield schools in five years?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>successful</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>teachers stay</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>achieving**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>proud**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>student-centered**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>thriving</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>innovative</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>individualized</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>communicative</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>model for other schools</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>100% of graduates all knowing their next steps</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I want to use to describe the Pittsfield community in five years?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>united</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>positive**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>clean**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>home</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>growing**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>clost knit</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>lively</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>safe</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>proud**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>connected</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>active**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>welcoming</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>strong</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>friendly**</em></strong></strong></p></li></ul><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><strong>Overall, the themes that emerged from the Kick-Off focused on the size and demographic characteristics of the schools and community now (small, struggling, poor, changing), the community\u2019s sense of itself and its schools now (supportive, dedicated, caring), and its aspirations for the future of the schools and community (proud, achieving, student centered, active, positive, clean, friendly).</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Once these issues were uncovered, the conversation topics\u00a0were able to be decided and the conversations could begin.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Five facilitated groups of 8-12 people met over a period of three weeks for two hours each week to address the framing questions.

The report was focused for the Nellie Mae Foundation, in hopes that they would fund the transformation plan over a six-year period to help the community and schools create a student-centered\u00a0learning environment\u00a0for Pittsfield students.</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong>This is the statement by PWY and NL Listens representative, as written in the full report presented to the Nellie Mae Foundation...</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><em><strong>\"Pittsfield is a strong community with a substantial core of dedicated, caring residents, many of whom have lived there most of their lives. There is a shared sense of duty to the community and its schools, expressed as a shared desire to see the schools improve such that more students graduate with high aspirations for continued education and career success. In order to achieve this goal, much more attention needs to be placed on innovative, creative, frequent forms of communication within the school and between the school and community. The schools need to be perceived as responsive to the community and the parents whose children attend them. Likewise, the community must be supportive of its schools through partnerships, involvement in school activities, and investment in new initiatives such as a magnet school. An ultimate goal of school improvement should be to create a strong sense of pride across all members of the community, whether they are long-time residents or newcomers who have moved here recently, affluent or not, young or old.</strong></em></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><em><strong>With respect to the schools, there is consensus that a student-centered curriculum that exposes students to a wider range of subject matter (including the arts) and that recognizes individual learning differences is critical. Expectations for appropriate behavior must be clear and enforced. Students and parents want close, positive relationships with teachers and administrators. More experiential learning, both within the schools and in the community, is seen as desirable. Accountability on all sides is seen as a crucial ingredient of school and community strength.

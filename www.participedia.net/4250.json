{"htmlbody": "<h2>Dataset on Brazilian Participatory Budgeting: 1989 to 2012</h2><p>The Brazilian Participatory Budgeting (PB) Census is a data set that Participedia contributor <a href=\"http://www.spadap.com/\">Paolo Spada</a> began collecting in 2008. It integrates and updates previous data collection efforts by Ribeiro &amp; De Grazia (1997-2002) and Avritzer &amp; Wampler (2004). The census includes all Brazilian cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants from 1989 through 2012 and identifies those that have implemented Participatory Budgeting. The resulting data set contains approximately 500 cities for six time periods, divided into four-year intervals. The PB census is geolocated and easily integrates with existing data sets maintained by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (<a href=\"http://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;Itemid=61\">IPEA</a>), the Superior Electoral Court (<a href=\"http://english.tse.jus.br/\">TSE</a>), and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (<a href=\"http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/\">IBGE</a>).</p><p>The census uses Yves\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_DG-25_bf.pdf\">Sintomer's five criteria</a></strong>\u00a0to define participatory budgeting, and is created using\u00a0a two-step methodology. First, internet research is conducted to identify elements that indicate the potential presence of participatory budgeting in a city. Next, each potential PB site is contacted by phone to determine whether or not the city has implemented participatory budgeting. The data set uses a four-year coding scheme that follows the electoral cycle. A city is coded as having implemented participatory budgeting if it has completed at least two cycles of participatory budgeting. This method was used twice to conduct a census: first in the spring of 2008 and a second time in the spring of 2012. See \"Full PB Census 1989 to 2012.\")</p><p>In 2012, Spada together with Brian Wampler, Mike Touchton, and Denilson Coelho, implemented a more detailed telephonic survey in the census to obtain data on the variety of designs of participatory budgeting. The results of the new survey are included below. (See \"PB Census 2012 - variety of PB survey.\")</p><p>In 2016 a team of Brazilian and US researchers will replicate the 2012 \"variety of PB\" survey and create the first stage of a panel (longitudinal) data set that will allow researchers to link the variety of PB designs to policy outcomes. The core development team is comprised of Wagner de Melo Rom\u00e3o, Paolo Spada, Brian Wampler, and Mike Touchton. Many additional Brazilian scholars are providing support. The research is funded by a grant from the S\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.fapesp.br/en/\">FAPESP</a>).</p><p>The data is currently being used in several ongoing research projects and can be downloaded below:</p><p>\"<strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/sites/default/files/Full%20PB%20census%201989%20to%202012.xlsx\">Full PB Census 1989 to 2012</a></strong>\" by\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/people/paolospada\">Paolo Spada</a></strong>\u00a0(licensed under\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0\">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a></strong>)<br/><em>Covers the census from 1989 to 2012, including a legend</em></p><p>\"<strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/sites/default/files/PB%20Census_2012_participedia.xlsx\">PB Census 2012 - variety of PB survey</a></strong>\" by\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/people/paolospada\">Paolo Spada</a></strong>\u00a0(licensed under\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0\">CC BY-NC-SA 3.0</a></strong>)<br/><em>Includes responses to the spring 2012 survey with results from the more detailed telephonic survey conducted later in 2012.

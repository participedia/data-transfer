NYFJ\u2019s Legacy Project \u201cPressing for Food Justice to Press Against Diabetes\u201d aimed to educate and activate the Black and Latino communities from diverse faiths in Harlem and the South Bronx regarding food disparity, and to collaborate on advocacy efforts to address food deserts in New York City through local government policies.\u00a0</p><p>Here is the mission as stated on their web site: \"NY Faith &amp; Justice envisions a city where New Yorkers and their communities are released from the oppression of poverty and the poverty of riches. We work for a day when rich and poor follow Jesus\u2019 call to live into their need one for the other. We envision the church drawn together and ignited by the vision of Isaiah 61, where practiced justice grows our faith and practiced faith builds a just city. And we envision a New York where resources are shared and just policies are practiced because God\u2019s people are no longer dependent on the dollar \u2013 they are oaks of righteousness \u2013 dependent on God alone.\"</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": "New York Faith & Justice"}

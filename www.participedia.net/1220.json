{"htmlbody": "<p class=\"documentDescription\">As part of Hertfordshire County Council's localism agenda, \u00a350,000 was allocated for an event in Adeyfield using participatory budgeting principles. Surveys on the percentage of people who feel they can influence decisions in their locality, had highlighted that the lowest scores throughout Hertfordshire were in Dacorum Borough and, within Dacorum, the lowest scores were to be found in the Adeyfield neighbourhood of Hemel Hempstead. </p>\u00a0<strong><em>This case study was originally submitted to the Participatory Budgeting Unit by the organisers of the project, using a template supplied by the PB Unit.</em></strong><h3>Overview:</h3><p>A steering group, mainly made up of local residents was set up in summer 2010, invitations to local groups to bid for projects meeting local needs (as published in the Adeyfield neighbourhood action plan) were invited in September and the decision day held on 13th November. 20 bids were submitted and 176 people attended the decision day \u2013 far exceeding the organisers\u2019 expectations.<br/><br/>Preliminary results from the evaluation suggest an overwhelming support from local residents and councillors for this method of community engagement in an area with previously low levels of participation in community life. This was a pilot exercise with no guarantees of funding in future years. However, the success of the project has encouraged the organisers to seek funding from other sources, notably the business community in the area (which includes Hemel Hempstead\u2019s large Maylands industrial and commercial area) upon which to base similar events in future.</p><h3>Organisation:</h3>Dacorum Borough Council <h3>Aims:</h3><p>Surveys on the percentage of people who feel they can influence decisions in their locality, highlighted that the lowest scores throughout Hertfordshire were in Dacorum Borough and, within Dacorum, the lowest scores were found in the Adeyfield neighbourhood of Hemel Hempstead.</p><h3>Where:</h3><p>As part of Hertfordshire County Council's localism agenda, \u00a350,000 was allocated for an event in Adeyfield using participatory budgeting principles to encourage local people to decide what projects were needed in the area and to decide how the allocated funds should be allocated to enable some of these projects to happen</p><h3>How:</h3><p>A Steering Group was established comprising local residents, local councillors and local staff from schools and the police. This group arranged the publicity, timetable criteria for bids and the arrangements for inviting bids and the subsequent voting event.<br/><br/>Various events were held to raise awareness during the summer and autumn and help residents understand the process.<br/><br/>Some twenty bids were submitted (for a total sum of over \u00a3120,000), and were presented by their proposers at a decision day, labelled \u201cAdeyfield Action \u2013 You Choose\u201d on 13 November.</p><h3>Who:</h3><p>The process was led by Dacorum Borough Council\u2019s neighbourhood action team (working in partnership with Hertfordshire County Council) in this exercise, the first of its type in the county.</p><h3>What:</h3><p>Around 176 local people, of all ages, attended the event at the local community centre to decide on the bids that should be approved.<br/>After presentations from all 20 bidders and a subsequent question &amp; answer session, residents were asked to vote for the three projects they felt would best meet the needs of the area, in order of preference.<br/><br/>The successful bids included:</p><ul><li>An outdoor area at a local pre-school to be made safe for children and improve the environment locally.</li><li>A nature area at the local primary school to be open to the local community</li><li>A shelter for young people at the local adventure playground</li><li>Half the cost of a new mini-bus for the local secondary school (to be used by community groups as well)</li><li>New equipment for a boxing club</li><li>Items for a bingo club based in one of the neighbourhood\u2019s churches</li></ul><p>The event was recorded on video and more photographs can be viewed at <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38077137@N00/sets/72157625375112672/with/5171812463/\">http:<span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f1dede868686df979d98929a83df929e9cde81999e859e82dec2c9c1c6c6c0c2c6b1bfc1c1\">[email\u00a0protected]</span><script data-cfhash=\"f9e31\" type=\"text/javascript\">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>/sets/72157625375112672/with/5171812463/ </a><br/><br/>The full evaluation of the exercise is now being carried out. This will include consideration of the feedback forms completed by those attending (whether as bidders or local residents voting on the day). However, there was no doubt about the enthusiasm of those participating and about the hope that such an event will be held again.<br/><br/>The high turnout was a tribute to the hard work of the very energetic Steering Group, the enthusiasm with which local schools joined in the initiative from the early days and the efforts of the council\u2019s Neighbourhood Action team in communicating with people and organisations throughout the area.<br/><br/>Of particular note is that the steering group decided to reject the offer of using electronic voting devices in favour of traditional paper voting slips (with each voter given three preferential votes . This lengthened the count \u2013 but created an additional element of theatre (and fun) for all participants (bidders and voters) who gathered around the stage as the steering committee and local councillors conducted the count.<br/><br/>This was a pilot exercise with no guarantees of funding in future years.

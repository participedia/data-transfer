{"htmlbody": "<p>The Scottish Health Council was established in 2005 to promote <em>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</em> (PFPI) in the NHS in Scotland. A key aspect of its role is to support NHS Boards and monitor how they carry out their statutory duty to involve patients and the public in the planning and delivery of NHS services.</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Ensuring that NHS Boards listen and take account of people's views can help to achieve a \"mutual NHS\" that works in partnership with patients, carers and the public. The Scottish Health Council works toward an NHS which:</p><ul><li>has a patient-centred approach to care, based on an understanding of patients' needs, life circumstances and experiences; and</li><li>ensures that patients, carers and the public are able to influence the planning and delivery of NHS services.</li></ul><h3>Functions</h3><p>The Scottish Health Council is a committee of <a href=\"http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/\">Healthcare Improvement Scotland</a> but has a distinct identity. The National Office is based in Glasgow, and there are also 14 local offices based within the areas covered by each of the 14 territorial NHS Boards across Scotland.</p><p>The work of the organisation can be divided into a number of functions:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org/about_us/what_we_do/community_engagement.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Community Engagement and Improvement Support</strong></a> \u2013 providing proactive and tailored support for NHS Boards</li><li><a href=\"http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org/about_us/what_we_do/participation_review.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Participation Review</strong></a> \u2013 reviewing and evaluating NHS Boards' approaches to involvement through the Participation Standard</li><li><a href=\"http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org/about_us/what_we_do/service_change.aspx\"><strong>Service Change</strong></a> \u2013 supporting NHS Boards to meet the requirement to involve people when planning or changing local services</li><li><a href=\"http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org/about/functions/pn.aspx\"><strong>Participation Network</strong></a> \u2013 a centre for the exchange of knowledge, support, development and ideas.</li></ul><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.scottishhealthcouncil.org/\">Scottish Health Council - official website</a></p><p>Follow us on Twitter: <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SHC_org\">@SHC_org</a></strong></p>", "title": "Scottish Health Council"}

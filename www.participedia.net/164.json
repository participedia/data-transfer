{"htmlbody": "<h3>Definition</h3><p>The initiative process is a form of <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/direct-democracy\">direct democracy</a>. Two types of initiative process are widely in use today. \u00a0The first is called citizens\u2019 initiative or popular initiative (hereinafter, \u201ccitizens\u2019 initiative\u201d). In the citizens\u2019 initiative process, citizens draft a legislative bill or constitutional amendment (a \u201cmeasure\u201d), which they then propose by petition; if the petition receives sufficient popular support, the measure is then placed on the ballot and can be enacted into law by a direct vote of citizens. \u00a0Some citizens\u2019 initiative processes allow the government to make a counter-proposal to the measure; the government\u2019s counterproposal appears on the ballot with the measure.</p><p>The second type of initiative process is called agenda initiative or agenda-setting initiative (hereinafter \u201cagenda initiative\u201d). In the agenda-initiative process, citizens draft a proposed law or policy (a \u201cmeasure\u201d), which they then propose by petition; if the petition receives sufficient popular support, the measure is submitted to the legislature, which decides whether to enact or implement the measure. In some agenda-initiative processes, citizens may also participate -- by consultation or referendum -- after the measure has been submitted to the legislature.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Initiative processes are intended to solve the problem \u2013 arising in many democracies -- of governmental action (or inaction) that is inconsistent with the will of most citizens and that cannot be resolved by elections.</p><p>Many factors may cause a government\u2019s policies to fail to align with citizens\u2019 preferences in a way that elections cannot resolve; these include corruption; government officials\u2019 self-interest; ineffective legislative procedures; excessive partisanship among legislators; \u00a0social, economic, or cultural differences between government officials and citizens; low rates of voter turnout; lack of government transparency; and the influence of popular movements.</p><p>Where the citizens\u2019 initiative has been implemented, if the government acts in a manner inconsistent with most citizens\u2019 preferences or declines to implement a policy that most citizens prefer citizens may bypass the government and directly enact the laws they wish. Where the agenda initiative has been implemented, citizens may compel an unresponsive government to consider a law or policy that enjoys strong popular support.</p><h3>History</h3><p>The initiative process appears to have originated in Switzerland. \u00a0Most Swiss cantons began to use the citizens\u2019 initiative between 1845 and 1869.</p><p>In 1893 the U.S. state of California implemented citizens\u2019 initiatives at the county level, and in 1898 the California cities of Vallejo and San Francisco adopted the citizens\u2019 initiative. \u00a0As of 1911 the citizens\u2019 initiative was being used at the municipal level in 19 U.S. states. \u00a0Several U.S. states \u2013 with South Dakota being the first in 1898 -- implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative process at the state level during the Progressive Era. By 1918 nineteen U.S. states had authorized use of the state-level citizens\u2019 initiative.</p><p>In the U.S. as of 2012 twenty-seven states have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative at the state level and about 50% of all municipalities, including 80% of the largest cities, have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative. \u00a0In the 1950s and 1960s the number of state-level citizens\u2019 initiatives appearing on ballots declined in the U.S. \u00a0The number of state-level citizens\u2019 initiatives appearing on ballots in the U.S. has risen since the 1970s and a total of 159 citizens' initiatives were voted on in the U.S. in 2010.</p><p>In Europe as of 2012 ten countries appear to have adopted the citizens\u2019 initiative at the national level and 13 appear to have adopted the agenda initiative at the national level. At least 9 European countries have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative at the local level. Further, the European Union has implemented the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/\">European Citizens\u2019 Initiative</a>, which, despite its name, is an agenda initiative.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region as of 2012 five nations seem to have authorized use of the citizens\u2019 initiative at the national level.</p><p>In Africa as of 2012 Kenya and Uganda appear to have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative at the national level, and Botswana, Cape Verde,\u00a0and Uganda appear to have implemented the agenda initiative at the national level.</p><p>In Latin America as of 2012 six nations seem to have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative at the national level and 4 at the regional or local level. \u00a0Eleven nations seem to have implemented the agenda initiative at the national level and 3 at the regional or local level.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>In most jurisdictions that have implemented the initiative process, no formal deliberation about initiatives occurs. One exception is the U.S. state of Oregon, which has implemented the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-initiative-review\">Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review</a> \u2013 a <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury\">Citizens\u2019 Jury</a> that deliberates about a citizens\u2019 initiative \u2013 as part of its official statewide citizens\u2019 initiative process. \u00a0The Oregon process is called the <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir\">Oregon Citizens\u2019 Initiative Review</a>.</p><p>In the absence of a formal deliberative process, citizens rely on several different sources of information \u00a0to gather information for their informal deliberations and decision making about initiatives.\u00a0</p><p>In many jurisdictions that have implemented the citizens\u2019 initiative, the government distributes to voters information about initiatives on the ballot in a booklet called a voters\u2019 guide or voters\u2019 pamphlet (hereinafter a \u201cvoters\u2019 guide\u201d). In some jurisdictions civil society organizations also produce unofficial voters\u2019 guides providing information about initiatives.</p><p>Citizens may use the information about initiatives appearing in voters\u2019 guides during informal deliberations and decision making about ballot initiatives.</p><p>In some jurisdictions that have implemented the initiative process, advocates supporting or opposing an initiative may distribute information and arguments about initiatives through political campaigns, which may involve advertising, other kinds of promotional materials, op-ed articles in news media, Internet marketing, social media marketing, mass media appearances, and public events.</p><p>In some jurisdictions, when an initiative of great public interest is being circulated or will appear on the ballot news organizations or civil society organizations may hold forums \u2013 on mass media, on the Internet, or at public meeting places -- at which citizens may learn more about the initiative and hear advocates\u2019 arguments supporting or opposing the initiative.\u00a0</p><p>Research suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about initiatives. \u00a0Some surveys show that voters have low levels of awareness and knowledge of initiatives. In the U.S. initiatives are frequently invalidated by courts on the grounds that the initiatives conflict with constitutional or other law; this suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about the legal aspects of initiatives. Further, the language of initiatives and voters\u2019 guides frequently exceeds the reading ability of most voters, and campaign advertisements about initiatives often contain false or misleading claims. This evidence suggests the initiative processes in many jurisdictions could be improved by increasing the quality of information citizens receive about initiatives.</p><p>Research also shows that in some circumstances initiative processes have led to good decisions. These include the enactment of initiatives that benefit most citizens but are inconsistent with the interests of incumbent legislators, such as initiatives that create new and effective governmental bodies or that impose taxation caps or term limits. \u00a0Research also shows that initiative processes may benefit citizens by increasing citizens\u2019 participation in politics as well as citizens' sense of empowerment.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Shaun Bowler and Todd Donovan.

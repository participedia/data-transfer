Due to the small size of Iceland\u2019s economy, this crisis is the largest banking collapse to occur to any country in economic history.<a href=\"#ftnt1\" id=\"ftnt_ref1\" name=\"ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a>\u00a0Thousands of Icelanders lost their jobs because of this collapse and consequential government action, sending the country into further economic decline. Since the initial collapse, a number of rallies and protests have taken place. The largest of these rallies took place on January 20, 2009 and resulted in many officials resigning and scheduled elections being moved up a number of weeks.\u00a0</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"DefinitionTEXT\" name=\"DefinitionTEXT\"><strong>Definition, assembly creation and history</strong></a></h3><p class=\"c2 c13\">\u00a0</p><p>After the previous government\u2019s collapse at the hands of debilitating protests, citizens started to have a larger influence on shaping Iceland\u2019s political landscape.\u00a0One result of this is that citizens became involved in creating a new constitution as well as participating in a National Assembly, the \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0fundur.\u00a0The purpose of the assembly was to declare the fledgling country\u2019s values and give citizens a voice in Iceland\u2019s rebuilding in the aftermath of its collapse.</p><p>Several grassroots organizations, calling themselves \u201cthe Anthill,\u201d collaborated to bring about the Assembly. \u00a0The name, they say, refers to the fact that \u201canthills have some sort of collective wisdom that each individual ant does not have.\u201d There had been no discussions of a forum of this type, or citizen-government engagement at this level, prior to the economic collapse.</p><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"h.x8thd1mokdtx\" name=\"h.x8thd1mokdtx\"></a><a id=\"OriginTEXT\" name=\"OriginTEXT\">Originating Entities and Funding</a></h3><p class=\"c2\">The plan for deliberating reform of the government through what came to be known as the National Assembly was introduced by Gudj\u00f3n Mar Gudj\u00f3nsson, an entrepreneur who has founded several successful companies and is presently working with the Ministry of Ideas, a social reform think tank. The think tank\u2019s mission includes \u201cpursuing how Icelanders can breakdown hierarchies that elevate people like [Gudjon Mar Gudjonsson] above the rest of society\u201d <a href=\"#ftnt14\">[13]</a>. As a social reformer, he believed that Iceland needed a more \u201cparticipatory\u201d democracy, with everyone, regardless of social status having an opportunity to play a role in reshaping the government. Gudj\u00f3nsson\u2019s experience, such as serving as a consultant on a variety of projects for the Icelandic government, and being responsible for designing the country's Ministry of Communications in 1998, led him to undertake the difficult task of restructuring Iceland\u2019s government <a href=\"#ftnt18\">[17]</a>. </p><p class=\"c2\">Assembly organizer, Halla Tomasd\u00f3ttir, is a businesswoman who has held leading positions at the Icelandic stock exchange and the chamber of commerce. Both she and Gudj\u00f3nsson believed that the Assembly's core values should be a guide to the implementation of new laws and propositions being used for economic recovery. In regards to finances, the Assembly gained extensive backing from the Icelandic government; they covered roughly a quarter of the total funding, which was about 217,000\u00a0 USD<a href=\"#ftnt16\"> [15]</a>. The rest of the funding came from various individuals and organizations that participated and/or supported the Assembly <a href=\"#ftnt14\">[13]</a>. The results of the National Assembly are not legally binding since the Assembly is a grassroots movement. However, through the involvement of both the government and private donors in supporting this assembly, the intended consequences are to increase participation in both the economy and the government. The combination of both public and private funding in order to host this Assembly shows the commitment of the government as well as the people to the success and prosperity of the Icelandic government.</p><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"h.xg32iaof5vcn\" name=\"h.xg32iaof5vcn\"></a><a id=\"participantTEXT\" name=\"participantTEXT\">Participant Selection</a></h3><p class=\"c2\">1,500 participants, aged 18 and older, were selected to take part in the National Assembly, a number which equates to roughly 0.5% of Iceland\u2019s total population. 1,200 of those participants were randomly selected using the national registry, and were sent invitations via the post. Each native Icelander, as well as anyone with a permanent residence in Iceland, receives a unique identification number known as \u201ckennitala\u201d. The youngest participant was 18 and the oldest was 88, so there was a diverse representation of age groups. Those in charge of the Assembly sent letters out to the 1,200 selected individuals. Whenever any of the initial 1,200 people did not respond, more invitations were sent to other randomly selected individuals from the National Registry. This ensured that a total number of 1200 participants for the National Assembly. The other 300 participants were specifically chosen and included representatives of institutions and associations that were determined to be important enough in order to have their interests heard. The assembly was funded partially by the companies that these select 300 participants represented\u00a0<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/national-assembly-iceland-2009#ftnt17\">[16]</a>.</p><p class=\"c2\">\u00a0</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"deliberationTEXT\" name=\"deliberationTEXT\"><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></a></h3><p class=\"c2\">At the Assembly, the 1,500 participants were split into nine groups\u2014a number decided by Gudjonsson, in order to make the deliberation more manageable. Each group was assigned a moderator, whose responsibility it was to make sure that the group stays on task and that the participants in the discussion were courteous to one another. The moderators were trained and selected by Anthill, the primary organization behind the National Assembly. Each of the nine groups began by discussing what values they considered to define them as a nation. After each of these groups came up with their values, all of their selected values were tagged electronically and sent to staff working in the backroom, who then would determine the most important values from the combined results of the nine groups.</p><p class=\"c2\">The backroom staff made their determinations based off of the number of times each value appeared in the overall group discussion. Out of the sorted values, they then selected the top nine issues that appeared\u2014the number nine was chosen by Gudjonsson, because according to him, nine is the optimal number for group work; since he was the organizer of the event, the National Assembly chose the top nine as \u201cIceland\u2019s moral pillars for the purposes of the National Assembly\u201d\u00a0<a href=\"#ftnt14\">[13]</a>. Using these nine \u201cmoral pillars\u201d, each group would base their discussions of the nation\u2019s economic, education, justice, and health care systems around the principals held by these moral pillars. By the conclusion of the Assembly, the participants would draw their conclusions together and produce a unified proposal for improving Iceland\u2019s economic, education, justice, and health care systems. This proposal would not have any legal influence. Rather, it would serve as a \u201cguiding light\u201d telling Iceland\u2019s officials in which direction Icelanders want their country to go, with the National Assembly itself serving the purpose of a model for necessary reform. The close relationship between the National Assembly and the government enables Icelanders to have a more direct say, which, Gudjonsson states, makes Iceland an example that other countries will look towards in an effort to create a more sustainable democracy.</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"influenceTEXT\" name=\"influenceTEXT\">Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</a></h3><p class=\"c2\">The goals of the meeting were to come up with community values and priorities for rebuilding the nation, rather than determine specific stances on issues or implement policies.<a href=\"#ftnt2\" id=\"ftnt_ref2\" name=\"ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a>\u00a0In this process, the large group collectively identified nine of their most important themes as well as four underlying values for their nation. The four values favored most by the Assembly included the following:</p><ol class=\"c6\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c4 c2\">Integrity</li><li class=\"c4 c2\">Equal Rights</li><li class=\"c4 c2\">Respect</li><li class=\"c2 c4\">Justice</li></ol><ol class=\"c15\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c0\">These values were also listed as important, but were not seen as integral as the first four. </li></ol><ol class=\"c18\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c16 c2\">Love - important</li><li class=\"c16 c2\">Responsibility - important</li><li class=\"c16 c2\">Freedom - important</li><li class=\"c16

c2\">Trust - high priority</li></ol><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"c2\">Reports from the group indicate that more than 12,000 ideas were discussed at the national meeting initially. \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0fundur officials, which used social networking extensively before, throughout, and after the assembly, posted those thousands of ideas online. \u00a0Many of these ideas were related to the nine core themes, also referred to as \u201cpillars of the country,\u201d identified at the Assembly, and are posted on the respective pages. \u00a0These nine themes included the following:<a

After settling on these nine pillars out of nearly 12,000 ideas presented in the meetings, they drew on them to create direct action statements. \u00a0These thousands of ideas and action statements can be found on each pillar\u2019s Facebook page, linked to in the footnotes. \u00a0</p><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"c2\">Some might interpret these action statements as policy recommendations. For example, one such statement for education was \u201ckeep the school system free\u201d or \u201chave a more diverse graduating class,\u201d but it did not offer policies or legislation on how to fund these recommended actions. \u00a0Again, though the government played a part in creating and guiding the National Assembly, the results of this Assembly were non-binding on the government. \u00a0As one journalist blogged: \u201c I think our authorities would be VERY FOOLISH [sic] not to take the results of the National Assembly into account when forming their future policies. \u2026 [Participants] will be invested in seeing them implemented.\u201d</p><p class=\"c2\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"c2\">After obtaining a consensus on pillars, values, and action statements, participants were actually able to influence the Icelandic government's actions for an economic recovery plan. They ended up outlining a 52-week recovery plan where there was a specific goal for each day.<a href=\"#ftnt12\" id=\"ftnt_ref12\" name=\"ftnt_ref12\">[11]</a>\u00a0</p><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><p>Vitally, the National Assembly demonstrated the wisdom of the people and how to go about harnessing it. It showed that: 1) such an event could \u201csuccessfully elicit meaningful participation by a cross-section of a whole population, providing an opportunity for constructive dialogue and resulting in tangible data to form a picture of a desired future\u201d; 2) it is possible to \u201cdevelop a new way of conversing by creating a shift from a dialectic and polarized traditional discussion to a values based constructive dialogue based on possibilities and diverse interests\u201d; 3) \u201cwe are able to create a publicly available open space methodology and guidelines for organizing social dialogue with the purpose of using creativity and constructive dialogue to develop a shared vision\u201d. <a href=\"#ftnt_22\">[19]</a></p><p>After having the National Assembly in 2009, there was also another National Assembly hosted a year after, in 2010 where the task was more challenging. Rather than just determining a set of national values, the assembly had to generate principles for the new constitution (8). The Assembly in 2009 was the necessary foundation that had to be laid out in order for Iceland to progress into the 2010 Assembly and the tougher task of generating more crucial ideas.</p><h3 class=\"c2\"><a id=\"analysisTEXT\" name=\"analysisTEXT\">Analysis and Critiques</a></h3><p>Important shortcomings must also be kept in mind. Although the National Assembly was useful in encouraging citizens to participate in the rebuilding of their own government, it may have featured an overly critical view of the previous government in light of the bank meltdowns and government breakdown. \u00a0By holding the Assembly as reactionary to the aforementioned events, participants were more likely to associate the previous mechanisms of governance as failures which led to those events, when perhaps not all previous mechanisms of governance contributed to that collapse.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned in the outcomes section, the Assembly was non-binding on government action. \u00a0Although elected officials would have likely faced extreme criticism from participants and the citizenry as a whole if the recommendations were not followed, the government could have made the choice to continue in its unsatisfactory way, albeit it an unlikely option.</p><p>However, some criticism may also stem from too great an expectation. In particular, the event generated among the people the expectation that \u2018someone else\u2019 i.e. officials would do something tangible with the values and themes identified through the event. Disappointment inevitably set in, with some thinking the event nothing more than a \u2018feel-good\u2019 exercise. Nevertheless, the National Assembly proved itself to be useful in two concrete ways. <a href=\"#ftnt_22\">[19]</a></p><p>First, the process itself was important in that it involved a significant number of the population in such a manner that it created a strong impetus for change. This is evident in the fact that further events borrowing the methodology used in the National Assembly are continually taking place, and these events are involving more and more people. The National Assembly, in some sense, stimulated the population into becoming directly involved in the governance of their country. <a href=\"#ftnt_22\">[19]</a></p><p>Second, and most importantly, it had a strong influence on the redrafting of Iceland\u2019s new constitution. In 2010, the Parliament of Iceland decided to call for another National Assembly to engage the people directly in a discourse about the constitution. This event involved 1000 people randomly selected from the National Registry. The original constitution was handed down to the Icelandic people by the Danish King in 1874. This time, the people themselves would take ownership of the constitution by creating it. The results of the second National Assembly \u2013 a 700 page document \u2013 formed the base material from which a publicly elected constitutional council would draw ideas for the various elements of the constitution. Although this National Assembly had a different purpose, the collective wisdom of the nation was harnessed in a similar process of discussions in rounds. Without the 2009 event, this manner of generating the constitution would have been unthinkable. Also, several members of the constitutional council said that being able to make reference to the output of the National Assembly allowed them to decide unanimously and within just four months on the full draft proposal for the new constitution. <a href=\"#ftnt_22\" target=\"_self\">[19]</a></p><p class=\"c2\">Another strength worth keeping in mind is that the National Assembly procedures can, without much adjustment, be replicated in numerous other contexts. Not only has the event been widely praised by participants and Icelandic government officials, but it has served as a model for other deliberative assemblies and conventions, most recently the Irish We The Citizens work.<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/cases/national-assembly-iceland-2009#ftnt13\">[12]</a>\u00a0The process is also appropriate for smaller community settings such as cities and neighbourhoods, especially since the discussions will be limited to factors only relevant to that particular community.</p><p class=\"c8 c2\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"c2\">\u00a0</p><p

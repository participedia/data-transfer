{"htmlbody": "<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3>The Backbone Campaign\u2019s goal is to give a voice to community members and the masses, alike, by way of \u201cArtful Activism\u201d (Backbone Campaign). \u00a0Through the teaching of non-violent techniques and strategies, the Backbone Campaign looks first to give individuals the tools to have an effective political voice, and second to implement those skills in a manner that generates a dialogue between political leaders and those that they represent. \u00a0Through the creation and utilization of \u201cinnovative messaging and political theater \u2026[as well as] creative tactics such as spectacle imagery and other festival arts, giant banners and puppets, flash mobs, music and other theatrical forms of non-violent direct action,\u201d the Backbone Campaign believes that they can restore a political voice to the American public.\u00a0\u201cThe Backbone Campaign awakens and inspires Americans to build a progressive movement, reclaim our government, and secure a future worthy of our children.\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Mission Statement via <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7g04Mp-78U\"><em>Meet the Backbone Campaign</em></a><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3>The Backbone Campaign was conceptualized and set into motion by a group of artists on Vashon Island\u2014near Seattle, Washington\u2014in 2002. \u00a0Some of the initial goals of the project were to create signs to show politically motivated messages at freeway overpasses, and\u2014on a more national level\u2014market their creative skills and the concept of a Backbone Campaign to progressive movements in the Washington DC area. \u00a0However, after being met with less than satisfactory interest, the artists switched their focus to their own community, as well as other similarly progressive, grassroots organizations around the country. \u00a0In the Campaign\u2019s inaugural year, they gave out a series of \u201cBackbone\u201d awards\u2014<a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/media/conyers_award2__200.jpg\">featuring a golden spinal column</a>\u2014to the likes of Jim McDermott, Howard Dean, and Cynthia McKinney for their commitment to upholding progressive values in the face of great adversity.\u00a0\u00a0By 2004, the Backbone Campaign had created their own progressive platform, which they utilized to, \u201cintroduce progressive values and language into local and state party platforms through the 2004 caucus process and the 2004 DNC platform committee hearings\u201d (<em>Meet the Backbone Campaign</em>). \u00a0In 2004, the artists of the Backbone Campaign also created a <a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/slideshows/Guantanamo/images/DSC02702_JPG.jpg\">70-foot-long backbone puppet</a>, with a progressive platform item on each vertebra, which was used at demonstrations along the West Coast, eventually making it to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \u00a0 Along with the spine, Backbone artists also created the \u201cBush and Co. Chain Gang\u201d\u2014giant puppet heads made in the likenesses of <a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/slideshows/ChainGangWAConvention/DSC05829.html\">Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush, wearing prison uniforms and shackles</a>. \u00a0In their effort to continue to promote accountability, the Campaign also gave out a number of \u201cSpine Awards\u201d to politicians and activists who had done work on a community scale. \u00a0They also created their \u201c\u2018Thank and Spank\u2019 citizen lobbying tools\u201d that presented representatives with \u201cSpine Cards\u201d when they stood up for progressive values or policies, or \u201cSpineless Citations\u201d when they voted against progressive principles. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In the eight years since, the Backbone Campaign has taken on many nationally relevant projects, and allied itself with similar organizations such as Move To Amend, the Puffin Foundation West, MoveOn.org, and Occupy Wall Street, in order to further achieve their goals. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Supporters and participants involved in the Campaign\u2019s work are quite varied, based on Backbone\u2019s goal to provide training, strategies, and \u201ccreative tactics\u201d to any who wish to communicate their discontent with politicians who refuse to stand firmly for the progressive ideals they\u2019ve committed to, or with companies that aim to exploit citizens or the environment. \u00a0Also, through their <em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp, the Backbone Campaign has made an effort to reach out especially to the Pacific Northwest\u2019s outdoor-oriented progressives, with a series of climbing and kayaking-based actions. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><h3>Major projects and events</h3><ul><li><strong><em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp</strong></li></ul>\u00a0The <em>Localize This!</em> Action Camp is held every summer at a camping space on Vashon Island. \u00a0For a week, participants are taught, \u201cGrand Strategy &amp; Creative Tactics; Community Supported Organizer Skills; Action Planning &amp; Earned Media; Anti-Foreclosure, Eviction Protection &amp; Buy-back; Organizing from a Human Rights Framework; [Non-Violent Direct Action], Tripod, Blockades Training; Rappelling, Kayak Safety &amp; Water-Based Tactics; Giant Puppet &amp; Banner Building; Economic Democracy Strategies; Drumming, Flash Mobs and More.\u201d \u00a0The week generally culminates with an organized action relating to a current issue\u20142010\u2019s action was a critique of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that corporations could limitlessly fund political candidates, and featured a song and dance inside a Target, titled, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FhMMmqzbD8\">\u201cTarget Ain\u2019t People,\u201d</a> that generated over a million and a half views on YouTube. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0<ul><li><strong>Shared Sacrifice My Ass</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In August of 2011, the Backbone Campaign helped to organize an action in Seward Park, on the shores of Lake Washington, aimed at challenging Washington\u2019s most affluent individuals and corporations to \u201cshare [in] the economic sacrifices [of] working families\u201d (\u201cShared Sacrifice\u201d). \u00a0The action involved songs and dancing, and giant signs held airborne by balloons\u2014one of which showed a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/backbone_campaign/6068450874/in/set-72157627365221715/\">partially covered behind, and the words, \u201cSharedSacrificeMyAss.org.\u201d</a> \u00a0The sign was positioned across the lake from the Mercer Island estate of billionaire, Paul Allen, and targeted him and more of Washington\u2019s wealthiest who were fighting the implementation of a new state income tax. \u00a0For the project, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Washington Community Action Network with the goal of showing the public that budget cuts for education and healthcare came as a result of middle and working class families having to take on too great of an economic burden. \u00a0The action attracted extensive attention from local news sources, as well as from other national, progressive, grassroots organizations.\u00a0<ul><li><strong>For the People Rally &amp; Summit</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In January, 2012, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with Occupy Wall Street for Occupy the Courts, in Washington DC, as a second annual protest of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision granting corporate personhood. \u00a0Although much smaller, the event\u2019s predecessor stirred up a great deal of media attention in local news and led to articles in several progressive magazines, creating momentum for the 2012 action. \u00a0According to Bill Moyer, Backbone Campaign\u2019s Executive Director, the 2012 action included, \u201cstreet theater, giant banners, and even light projections on the Supreme Court and the [headquarters] of the US Chamber of Commerce\u201d (\u201cCreativity &amp; Bold Action\u201d). \u00a0As a result of the publicity gained through this year\u2019s action, the Backbone Campaign received interviews from Seattle\u2019s National Public Radio affiliate and PunkPatriot.com.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>Action-In-A-Box: Corporate Personhood Action Toolkit</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In late 2011, the Backbone Campaign collaborated with MoveToAmend.org to bring media attention to the debate of corporate personhood. \u00a0The goal of the action was to encourage the action of other grassroots efforts and motivated individuals by making participation easy. \u00a0To achieve this, the organization teamed up with a number of independent, supportive artists and organizations to create \u201cAction-in-a-Box\u201d toolkits. \u00a0The toolkits included instructions and materials for a number of action-oriented projects, as well as information about the history of the fight against corporate personhood in America (\u201cCorporate Personhood\u201d). \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>The 99% Choir Goes Christmas Caroling\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0Just before Christmas in 2011, the Backbone Campaign partnered with the Other 98%, the Seattle Labor Chorus, and the Washington Community Action Network to bring a Christmas-themed action to the Bank of America Tower in Seattle, Washington, along with several other Bank of America and Wells Fargo locations. \u00a0The carolers sung songs to bank-goers and personnel, like, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AVzKPR52M0&amp;feature=player_embedded\">\u201cWe\u2019ll Foreclose, We\u2019ll Foreclose, We\u2019ll Foreclose\u201d and \u201cDeck the Jails with Wall Street Bankers,\u201d</a> and left fake foreclosure notices from the 99% on the walls, citing, \u201cBribery, Fraud, [and] Extortion\u201d (Kouril). \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<ul><li><strong>The Fight for Puget Sound\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In July of 2008, after months of fighting, Glacier Northwest received the right to begin building a 400-foot pier, over state-owned aquatic lands, which would allow them access to the 192-acre gravel mine they had purchased on Maury Island (Brown). \u00a0The Backbone Campaign and others in the opposition contended that the pier\u2019s construction would have too many negative environmental impacts; but, after an investigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Glacier Northwest was allowed to continue. \u00a0In the following months, the legal battles continued, but legislation to protect Maury Island continued to fail on the State level. \u00a0During this time, the Backbone Campaign took an active role protesting,\u00a0in both the community and in the field, against\u00a0Glacier\u2019s advancements. \u00a0A group of kayakers\u2014dubbed \u201cThe Mosquito Fleet,\u201d and created to strategically hinder the progress of Glacier\u2019s water construction equipment\u2014made several appearances, earning local media attention. \u00a0\u00a0Through the start of 2009, actions led by the Backbone Campaign and the Mosquito Fleet to slow Glacier\u2019s progress continued, but going into the following spring, newly elected Governor Christine Gregoire remained unresponsive to Backbone\u2019s pleas for assistance. \u00a0At the start of the summer, the Backbone Campaign headed a petition demanding Gregoire\u2019s support, and warning of the intentions of that summer\u2019s Action Camp. \u00a0In July of 2009, with no compromise in sight, the Backbone Campaign teamed up with the Ruckus Society for another non-violent attack on Glacier\u2019s mining and construction operation\u2014during which, the Mosquito Fleet again did its job, hindering Glacier\u2019s abilities and generating media attention. \u00a0\u00a0Going into August, the Backbone Campaign and its collaborators had organized a rapid response team available 24/7 for actions against any incoming Glacier watercrafts. \u00a0At the End of August, Backbone\u2019s efforts paid off, as U.S. District Justice Ricardo Martinez ruled against the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 original environmental findings. \u00a0Over the next year, the battle for Maury Island continued in the courts, but after the King Country elections in November of 2010, CalPortland (Glacier\u2019s parent company) announced its agreement with the Cascade Land Conservancy and King County to sell the land to the public. \u00a0The result of the deal was the establishment of a 250-acre park\u2014the largest protected shoreline in the Puget Sound\u2014and a colossal victory for the Backbone Campaign and its supporters. \u00a0(\u201cTimeline to Victory\u201d)\u00a0<ul><li><strong>BP/Arco Boycott\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\u00a0In the wake of the 2010 BP oil spill, the Backbone Campaign planned an action to boycott BP/Arco Stations in the Seattle Area, and to place a banner on the Interstate-5 Yesler overpass. \u00a0The Campaign\u2019s protest caught the attention of local news as well as the FOX Business channel. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGrPo6927F8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Executive Director Bill Moyer went on FOX Business</a> to defend the boycott, and speak out against BP\u2019s political sponsorships and American dependence on foreign and domestic oil. \u00a0(\u201cBoycott of BP-ARCO\u201d) \u00a0\u00a0<p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction \u00a0</h3>The Backbone campaign is a collaboration between many individuals who donate their time and effort to promote the organization\u2019s success. \u00a0Below is a list of the Campaign\u2019s current staff, as listed by BackboneCampaign.org:\u00a0<ul><li>Executive Director: Bill Moyer</li><li>Managing Director: Yve Susskind</li><li>Project Organizer: Jared Middle Calf</li><li>Affiliated Artist/Puppetista: Christopher Lutter</li><li>Affiliated Artist: Steffon Moody</li><li>Affiliated NVDA Trainer: Logan Price</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0President Stan Sorscher</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0Treasurer Doug Skove</li><li>Board of Trustees:\u00a0Secretary Anne Gavzer</li><li>Board of Trustees: Trustee\u00a0John Sellers</li><li>Board of Trustees: Trustee\u00a0Jim Diers</li></ul><h2>Funding</h2><p>The Backbone Campaign, as a grassroots, non-profit organization, is funded by supporters\u2019 and participants\u2019 donations.</p><h3>Influences</h3><p>Through their constant commitment to create new actions, the organizers at the Backbone Campaign keep the organization, as well as similar organizations, in the political conversation. \u00a0The Backbone Campaign\u2019s strategies have been shown to be effective, and their work shows their commitment to improving and spreading those strategies. \u00a0\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ol><li>Backbone Campaign. 21 Feb 2012 &lt;<a href=\"http://backbonecampaign.org/&gt;\">http://backbonecampaign.org/&gt;</a>.</li><li>Brown, Leslie. \"Glacier gets OK for Maury Island dock, opponents vow to keep fighting.\" 10 July 2008.

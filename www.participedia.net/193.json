{"htmlbody": "<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy\">Deliberative democracy</a> (also called discursive democracy) is a form of democracy in which public deliberation is central to legitimate lawmaking. It adopts elements of both representative democracy and direct democracy and differs from traditional democratic theory in that deliberation, not voting, is the primary source of a law's legitimacy.</p><p>\"Deliberative democracy\" was originally coined by Joseph M. Bessette, in \"Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government,\" in 1980, and he subsequently elaborated and defended the notion in \"The Mild Voice of Reason\" (1994). Others contributing to the notion of deliberative democracy include Jon Elster, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, David Held, Joshua Cohen, John Rawls, Amy Gutmann, No\u00eblle Mcafee, John Dryzek, Rense Bos, James Fishkin, Dennis Thompson, Benny Hjern, Hal Koch, Seyla Benhabib, Ethan Leib, David Estlund and Robert B. Talisse.</p>", "title": "Deliberative Democracy"}

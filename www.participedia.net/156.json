{"htmlbody": "<p>\u201cChoosing Healthplans All Together\u201d (CHAT) is a small group simulation exercise designed to give the public a voice in setting health or health care spending priorities. It has been used for research, policy and teaching purposes. The exercise can be tailored and adapted to the needs of the populations/communities. Departments of Insurance in various states in the U.S. have used CHAT to determine public opinion about what should be included in basic health insurance packages for the uninsured. Some U.S. municipalities have used it to assess public priorities for direct service delivery to the uninsured. CHAT has also been used in other countries to engage the public in decisions about health or healthcare spending.  Research demonstrates that participants finds CHAT informative, easy to use, and a fair process, and, consistently, over 85% would be willing to abide by the decision reached by their groups. Participants also increase in their understanding of limited resources and necessary tradeoffs.\n</p><p>\nFor more information and images, see <a href=\"http://www.chat-health.org\">www.chat-health.org</a>\n</p>", "title": "Simulation Exercise"}

{"htmlbody": "<h3>Definition</h3><p>Citizen Dialogue -- also called Citizens' Dialogue -- is a public deliberation method created by <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/canadian-policy-research-networks\">Canadian Policy Research Networks</a>. The Citizen Dialogue method is based on <a href=\"http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning\">Viewpoint Learning</a>'s <a href=\"http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue\">Choicework Dialogue</a> method. In Citizen Dialogue a randomly selected sample of approximately 20 citizens is given a workbook about a policy issue, and then meets for one or two structured and moderated sessions of a total of 8 to 12 hours in length in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the policy issue. At the beginning and end of a Citizen Dialogue each participant completes a survey measuring the participant's attitudes about aspects of the policy issue discussed in the workbook. The final survey also contains items about the quality of the dialogue results.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>History</h3><p>Citizens\u2019 Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Canadian Policy Research Networks.

It makes it easy to obtain informed opinions on the budget in question as well as giving views on what is important regarding the budget; For example, whether to increase or decrease spending on a certain expenditure. It also allows to engage people who are hard to reach or sustain attention from, such as the lack of attentiveness that may arise from a regular, \u201cboring\u201d meeting. The cost of engaging so many people is done at minimal cost.\n</p><p>2.Dialogue App or Dialogue Platform: \n</p><p>This product allows for the sharing of ideas, online dynamic interaction (similar to Twitter or FaceBook) and the gathering of customer feedback. It is ideal for crowd-sourcing and promoting innovation and ideas exchange, running debates on issues that your community cares about. This application has been used by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to get people involved in important discussions. It provides easy to edit pages and built in reports that make it easy to look into and report on what is being discussed in the dialogue. And information on the site traffic to keep track of who and how often people are contributing.\n</p><p>3.Ideas Tree:\n</p><p>This product makes it easy to share, store and rate ideas quickly. Its whole purpose is to be very participatory, the most participation, the bigger it grows. Just like the other products, it is customize designed to fit the company that is using it. Any add on may be attached to the \u2018tree\u2019 including photos or images. One example of this is the use of it by the Department for Children, Schools, and Families. Using the 'idea tree'  the department was hoping to obtain information from parents to understand what  they felt were priorities and needs regarding their children.\n</p><p>4. Citizen Space (renamed from Opinion Suite) \n</p><p>Out of these four major products offered, this one is the only one that has the potential to be used at no cost. The only costs that would be charged to an account would be for those services the owner needs, such as set up, hosting, customization, maintenance, support or advice. Being an open source product it also allows for easy management as well as customization for the organization using it  . \n</p><p>An example of how a standard partnership may work includes the initial \u2018Consultation design\u2019 which is emphasizing the questions that need to be answered by the organization or enlighten the problems that need to be addressed. Background information is also acquired and as well as distribution of all policy documents and multimedia resources available. After all of the information is gathered then the \u2018Consultation distribution\u2019 phase is enabled where the delivery of the online and paper surveys are distributed. Paper surveys are offered to give the company more options on their research method. Once, this is done, phase three of the \u2018Stakeholder engagement and recruitment\u2019 begins. This includes recruiting participants, publicizing the products that have been chosen to be used as well as to hold events to further advertise and bring awareness of the actions to be taken. Phase four of \u2018Data entry and coding\u2019 is the cost efficient input of the results of the offline surveys. Phase five of \u2018Report writing and statistical analysis\u2019 is the complete analysis and report of the data collected which also includes publications to the stakeholders. The final phase is \u2018Consultancy\u2019 where advice is given and specialist project management is offered. \n</p><p>Citation:\n</p><p>Budget Simulator.

Their voice can be heard in many venues such as local councils, and on police and health services.

London Fire Brigade (2009) Draft Fourth London Safety Plan ( since closed for any more responses)\n</p><p>From November 30th 2009 to February 22 2010 the London Fire Brigade consulted on the draft of the London Safety Plan 2010/13. This was the fourth London Safety Plan and explains how the Brigade plan to build on its reputation as one of the world\u2019s leading fire \nand  rescue services. All responses were assessed and taken into consideration by the Authority at its meeting in March 2010. The views helped decide upon the content of the final plan, which was published in April 2010 on our website at\n<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.london-fire.gov.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.london-fire.gov.uk\">http://www.london-fire.gov.uk</a>. \n</p><p>The Plan includes a shake up of where some specialist vehicles and equipment are located across the capital. This is to deliver greater efficiency and improvement in the way equipment is deployed and firefighters are trained. It also includes new performance \ntargets, which will see the Brigade aim to reduce fires, which damage property, reduce arson and reduce the number of unwanted calls we attend.\n</p><p>Community Safety: We work to help people stay safe from fire and other emergencies, in the home, at work and in London\u2019s other buildings. Accidental fires in the home are the main cause of fire deaths and we do all we can to reduce these fatalities. We work to educate people about what they can do to protect themselves from fire. We do this by:  \n</p><p>1. Home fire safety visits - firefighters visiting people in their homes to give advice on fire safety and fitting smoke alarms for free if necessary.\n</p><p>2. Working with other organisations who work with people we know are most at risk from fires and help us to reach and protect them.\n</p><p>3. Informing people at a young age about the dangers of fire, how they can protect themselves and the consequences of making hoax calls. We have successful and award winning initiatives to do this, including a schools team.\n</p><p>4. Reducing deliberately started fires - we have a specialist team to tackle fire setting behavior by young people and another working with partners to reduce fire related crime.\n</p><p>5. Advising on fire safety in the workplace - as an employer you are responsible for making sure you and your staff know what to do to prevent a fire in the workplace and how to escape if a fire does break out.\n</p><p>6. Carry out inspections of buildings - to improve the safety of the buildings we work with  developers at an early stage, carry out inspections to make sure they meet fire regulations, and we take enforcement action when necessary.\n</p>\n<a id=\"Case_Studies\" name=\"Case_Studies\"></a><h2>Case Studies</h2>\n<p>Delib is dedicated to help their clients excel in their efforts of helping the communities and businesses.

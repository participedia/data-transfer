Surveys measure participants' beliefs and attitudes about the issue and the policy and funding approaches at the start and the end of the deliberation.

Social networks have greatly contributed in re-shaping the idea of online interactions, but their outcomes are, most of the time, a clashing chorus of lonely voices unable to listen to each other giving rise to unfruitful exchanges of ideas. From this point of view, web-mediated interactions are still far from being efficient means of communication, confrontation and, in the end, a means for effective decision making. It’s from the analysis of current practices in online interactions that we came up with the idea of Deebase: a CMS aimed at supporting communities in fostering the exchange of ideas among their members, turning chaotic interactions into full-fledged debates.","IntroductionSince the emergence of the so called Web2.0, internet technologies have greatly expanded the possibilities for people to interact and discuss; but how many times have we found ourselves trapped in endless debates about everyday facts?

The project is in no way a finalized one, but can provide some interesting ideas.
The whole system design is based on creating a simple, easy-to-use but still powerful enough system for direct democracy.
Main concepts are:
1)    two-level simple to-implement user delegation system, to allow user to be involved even if they do not have time and/or competence to join
2)    no implementation of law amending and collective law writing to avoid a too complex system
3)    having a central decisional group to coordinate law creation and voting. This group would however have no power to write or implement laws, just to control the whole process of system control
4)    direct feedback system (using a blog, for example) between users delegated to vote and user delegating their vote.

"VoterMedia","Mark Latham","VoterMedia is a new incentive structure for encouraging public interest media to develop, to flourish and to cover issues that matter to a voter community. A typical first-step implementation is a blog competition in a small democracy such as a student union or a municipality.

It is designed to improve the policies of democracies and corporations.","DefinitionVoterMedia is an incentive structure for encouraging public interest media to develop, to flourish and to cover issues that matter to a voter community.
